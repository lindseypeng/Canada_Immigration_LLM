      "Question: I (24,M,Canadian) met my girlfriend (27,F,South Korean) towards the end of her working holiday visa, we fell in love, blah blah blah, and the rest was history. Very early on in our relationship we realized that ultimately the goal would be to sponsor her, so that we could continue being a couple because we met roughly two months before her visa was due \n",

      "\n",
      "Long story short she moved in with me in preperation for the common-law sponsorship requirements(12 consecutivemonths living together). Thankfully while she was here she saved up a good chunk of money, and ended up applying for a tourist visa which we both thought would be one year. The visa was granted, but ended up being a 6-month tourist visa. However, after reading around (correct me if wrong), we found out that once her current tourist visa expires she can apply for another 6-month extension, which will take us to point where I'm eligible to sponsor her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flash forward to now. We have been happily living together for 7 months, and have both been relying heavily on the fact that in November (the month her first tourist visa extension expires), we can just apply for another one and everything will be cool. However, it is now October and this weekend we're starting the application for her second extension, and I can't help but worry that we may have done something wrong, or could have possibly gone a better route with this whole process. I'm even more so scared that what if her 2nd extension gets denied, because if it does, all of the sudden I'm without my partner who I love so much. Will the immigration officer think it's sketchy that she's extending again? Should we state somewhere on the next application that were applying again so that by the end of it, we will have been living together for 12 months? I have so many questions running through my head that I'm now panicking about since we're supposed to start the application this weekend.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that this is very last minute, and I know we should have made sure of these things earlier on, but if anyone has any feedback on how we went about things or even advice for her 2nd extension, or god forbid what to do if this second application gets denied, I would appreciate it so much.\n",
      "Top Answer: If I understand your post right, you started cohabitating with your girlfriend at the end of her working holiday visa. She then applied and granted a tourist visa that was valid for 6 months. You then wonder how to extend her stay in Canada. Am I right?\n",
      "\n",
      "If that is the case, she needs to apply for a [visitor record](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/extend-stay.html) at least 30 days before her status expires.\n",

      "Top Answer: The processing standard for both inland & outland remains 80% of applications completed in 12 months. You can find anecdotal evidence supporting each one being faster than the other, but the official processing remains the same for both of them. You will find outland applicants who have PR in 4 months and outland applicants who wait two years, just as you will find the exact same for inland. Going outland vs inland is no guarantee of quicker processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "If his ability to work is important to you, applying for an IEC and coming to Canada that way is likely a better option. AOR can take anywhere from a few weeks to six months, and the OWP processing is just as variable. Many people receive PR before receiving the OWP. If you want to apply for the OWP, you should anticipate him being out of work for at least a few months, whereas with an IEC he can arrive and begin working right away. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another option is to apply for the IEC and apply for an outland sponsorship right after you get married. Then the application will have started processing sooner, rather than waiting for you to move to Canada. You would need to update your address with IRCC to let them know you moved, but other than that it would have no effect. Then his PR would be started sooner, he'd be able to move with authorisation (no hassles about technically being in Canada as a tourist) and he'd be able to begin work upon arrival. \n",
      "\n",
      "Getting married in or outside Canada doesn't make any difference. The only possible difference is that, if the marriage certificate isn't in English or French it would need to be translated, but I would assume a certificate from New Zealand is already in English. So then there's no real difference.\n",

I think you should include a letter from your parents specifically pertaining to their financial support, and that they know their funds will be used to support your wife to the extent necessary and they’re delighted to help with her support.

Two or more summary convictions that make you inadmissible are eligible for deemed rehabilitation after five years since the most recent conviction. Explain it in the PR application and if for whatever reasons you’re deemed inadmissible you can apply for a TRP so you can come to or remain in Canada while you work out rehabilitation for the offenses pursuant to your PR.

I did this through immigration firm. All that's remaining, I'm told, is for IRCC to open the file - it's basically in queue. Now when it was first submitted Nov 2022, there was no \"immigration to Quebec takes approximately 24 months.\" It was basically 12-15 months. Recently, I guess, that (24 months) was applied.

We're coming up for 2 years in Jan, and ours still isn't finished, although we do have approval in principle now - everything's been completed, we're just waiting for the final go-ahead.\n",

Most lawyers and immigration advisers are actually suggesting that people look at other provinces to cut the time down by over half.\n",
      "\n",

      "If they did not also apply for a work permit at the same time, they need to extend their visitor status. Do not select \"Permanent\" since they have not been granted a PR yet - select something else so they can get past that step in the application. Make sure to mention they have a spousal sponsorship application in progress and provide relevant documentation and proof of funds for the requested stay extension.

      "NB: The reason \"permanent\" boots you out of the process is that the person is still considered a temporary resident until granted another status. If they indicate they want to stay permanently on a visitor record application, the application would be rejected, because that is not the correct application for permanent residency. Technically, until the applicant is granted the PR, they remain on temporary status and the status extension could be refused (e.g. if they apply to extend status but provide no proof of funds or do not fulfill other requirements for the extension such as providing biometrics or getting a medical exam).\n",

      "*However*, your process may actually go smoother and faster if you do end up just doing it per IRCC's request anyway. I have seen applicants who did not do it (nor did they need to) end up having their applications be delayed because the child's medical was not provided.

      "Essentially we argued that let's save everyone some time and money because if he were to be sponsored, you would have to accept him, and here is all the documentation you would need to make a decision in that instance.

We were contemplating which country we wanted to choose to make a life in and have decided on Canada! We love it here. He has visited 4 times and same goes for me (I don’t know if thats important information) He is now back in the USA. \n",

      "Top Answer: You must apply to extend your stay as a visitor if you won't get AOR before your work permit expires. You cannot work as a visitor, so on the date your work permit expires you must stop working until you receive the new work permit in-hand. Note that applying for the work permit as a visitor does not let you start working again, and current processing time for a work permit is listed at about 5 months, so you should be prepared not to work for several months if you don't get AOR in time to extend your stay as a worker.\n",

      "Top Answer: There are no requirements for the CSQ for the sponsorship. You do not need to show that you speak french. When your spouse gets approved as a sponsor, you will mail your application (undertaking and CSQ) to MIFI and you will get your CSQ. Yes, it's pretty much automatic.\n",

      "If she would like to wait with you inside Canada until she becomes a permanent resident, yes you can use the in-Canada procedure.

Your choice on not getting married or not living together to become common-law partners, while you came to Canada to visit her (and so when getting married or establishing cohabitation were options), doesn't make you eligible to apply for conjugal sponsorship. And before you push back telling me you couldn't stay in Canada for more than that 1 month because of your work; not being able to live together to establish a common-law partnership, due to work commitments also doesn't make you eligible to apply as conjugal partners (changing jobs, such as coming to Canada on a working holiday visa, an open work permit, for you to live together and become common-law partners, is something within your control, it's just a personal choice you're not making, and, again, conjugal partnership applications are not about barriers that come from personal choices);\n",

Also, you wrote she now has a job and is self-sufficient, right? Her having been financial dependent on you, in the past (but not now), doesn't make you eligible for conjugal sponsorship.

      "Question: First, thank you for taking the time to read my post. I've scoured the FAQ and various Government of Canada websites, which have provided some insights. However, my situation is a bit unique, and I'm hesitant to consult professionals due to a previous bad experience while moving to Germany. If I overlooked something obvious, please let me know, but I have tried a bunch of targeted googling, so I hope I have the right bases of information.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Context:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Before moving to Germany, I was self-employed while also working a full-time job as a Marketing Director in Canada. Initially, my self-employment income was less than 30k CAD. However, since focusing on it full-time, the business has nearly doubled its output each year, and I'm now on track to make around 55k CAD. I transitioned my business to Germany and filed my last Canadian tax return, intending to stay abroad indefinitely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting a business in Germany took me four months, compared to just five minutes in Canada. Additionally, I couldn't work until my Visa was approved, which took a considerable amount of time. These delays, along with the move itself, have drained most of our funds. Now, with the added healthcare costs, we're facing a sunk cost fallacy situation and are considering moving back to Canada.\n",

      "Edit: The way healthcare works in Germany is different from what many might assume. To qualify for public healthcare as a self-employed individual, you need to have had public health insurance in your previous country. This wasn't something I initially thought was possible; rather, it was information provided to me by a professional recommended for immigration matters, as well as by  representatives from multiple public insurance agencies in Germany and even the wiki in r/germany. This turned out to be false.\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife, who is a student, doesn't earn enough from her side jobs to include me in her healthcare plan. As a self-employed individual, I don't qualify for public health insurance, either. The only option left was private insurance, which quoted us around 1300 CAD per month because of my disability. This absurd cost is a significant factor in our decision to move back to Canada, where I could easily cover the cost of my wife's education with that amount.\n",

      "**Our Plan:**\n",
      "\n",
      "I intend to return to Alberta, Canada this November and officially transfer my business back by January 1st.

We'll apply for her sponsorship from my parents' address.\n",

      "My wife (Almost perfect English) aims to go back to school to become a teacher. While waiting for the sponsorship to go through, she might take up a job like waitressing through an open work permit, which we understand can be tackled during the application process. Alternatively, she could volunteer, particularly in educational settings, to build her resume for her future teaching career.\n",

      "**Concerns:**\n",

      "Only after we followed up by email we were informed that dependent missed the deadline. (The HK office deemed the last day for principal applicant to land to CA to be the same deadline for dependent to send passport, though the ready for visa letter did not seem to attribute this deadline to the dependent in any way).  \n",
      "We now want to re apply, this time would be family class as the sponsored applicant is outside Canada (unless there are any means to reconvene the old application despite a year having elapsed since?)  \n",
      "One thing bothering me is; CIC states that a sponsor may be ineligible if they previously applied to sponsor current spouse and a decision has not been made.  \n",
      "It is confusing whether the above scenario would be seen as 'a decision has not been made'. Since we were informed by email of the decision yet no official documents were provided to support a decision.  \n",
      "Another point to consider, the new CIC tracker tool still displays our old application as \"in progress\". On the timeline graphic, the last recorded day is the day the dependent sent passport to HK embassy through the designated VFS service.  \n",

I know that if I have ECOPR by then travelling back home to Canada with my spouse will be no issue. What im wondering is what if we dont have ECOPR by then?
