jmwlr3,Meta,PSA: Application Processing Times,"I felt compelled to make a post about IRCC processing times after seeing so many posts here asking ""how long did your X application take""?

I can give those who ask this type of question the benefit of the doubt, as they may not know about the official IRCC webpage showing [processing times](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/check-processing-times.html). But if you don't know, asking how long someone else's application takes should *not* be taken as a ""fact"" of how fast applications are processing. Their application is not your application, and just because they were approved in 4 weeks doesn't mean you will be too. Yes, 26 weeks to process a study permit application is ridiculous. But that's what it is right now.

Processing times are lengthy and screwed up right now. The linked webpage shows as much. But IRCC does continuously update processing times as they know them right now. Just because you *think* the listed processing time is too long or you don't *like* it, doesn't mean the time is wrong or inaccurate.

All anyone can do right now is go by the *official* processing times, assume that your application will take that long to process, and plan accordingly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/jmwlr3/psa_application_processing_times/,"Are we sure they are being updated?

Citizenship certificates, just the proof of citizenship, shows that it takes 5 months. I haven't found a single person online who had it take less than a year. 

I think that's why people ask. I sent in the form for proof of citizenship for my daughter and it arrived 2 months ago and I don't even have an acknowledgement of receipt yet. From the people I've spoken with, it seems like it is taking 6 months just to get the receipt. 

I think that's why people ask- because if the site says 5 months, but, you can't find a single person on the internet who had it take less than a year, well, you start to doubt the site information just a bit. 

Additionally, each of the pages right now have a warning saying that due to Covid they cannot estimate. They literally say on the page that the numbers cannot be estimated due to the situation. When I call, I'm told they are processing applications from January. That's 6 months longer than their website says it takes."

two87t,Meta,"How (not) to use this sub, or: read the sticky “Welcome” post before posting.","This sub is mostly devoted to asking and answering questions about Canadian immigration. It can be a great resource for potential immigrants to find information from previous posts or ask questions about their unique situation (hint: 9/10 your situation is not unique and has been answered before). 

To the people asking for advice/information: the people answering your questions are doing so for free because they want to. They’re not obligated to answer your questions, and you’re not entitled to a response to your post (even if you type “URGENT” in the title). If they do answer your question, understand that they are answering based *only* on the information you have given, and probably know more about Canadian immigration than you. And if they’re wrong, they’re generally downvoted, corrected by someone else, or their post is removed for inaccuracy. It seems like as good a system as you could expect for Reddit.

If you truly need (urgent) immigration advice, you should contact a Canadian lawyer or licensed immigration consultant. Yes, they may charge you a fee for a consultation. But it’s their *job* to do so. Immigration professionals can offer better advice for your specific situation than internet strangers on their lunch break who answer questions as a hobby and only know a paragraph of information about your entire life. 

Similarly, don’t contact IRCC for “advice”. They will not (or at least, “should” not) give you advice. Their job is to update you on existing applications, and direct you where to look online for more information. You should contact them if you have anything to update them on. But for real urgent or life-altering advice, a lawyer or consultant should be used. You may not want to hear that it can cost you money to get a “legitimate” answer to your immigration questions, but think of it this way: you’re free to prepare your own immigration application the same way you’re free to file your own taxes or fix your own toilet.

Do read the “Welcome to r/ImmigrationCanada. Please read before posting” sticky before posting. Seriously. How many times has “can I come back to Canada without a PR card?” been asked. It’s in the FAQs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/two87t/how_not_to_use_this_sub_or_read_the_sticky/,"👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

So many “how do I move to Canada?” posts lately and people being rude because they don’t get an answer or don’t get the answer they wanted.

It’s the same on YouTube videos by immigration consultants. People ask questions specific to their own case then complain when the person who made the video doesn’t answer. First, they don’t even have to make these really helpful videos in the first place so be grateful that they are and second, this is their job, if you want their advice pay for it like everyone else does, don’t complain and  insult them because they won’t give it to you for free."
ciqm4h,Meta,[META] Political Parties on Immigration,"Dear all, 

As we are heading to 100-day countdown to the Election (unless Trudeau calls it early), I have been able to source each political party's position on immigration. I wanted the post to be as written in their documents or as stated by their Immigration Critic/Minister. 

I am doing this not so much to stoke fear or anxiety, in fact, I am hoping people would get clarity on what each party stands for. I will ensure that these are properly linked. Many of the focus here will be on skilled immigration and family reunification as opposed to refugees as quite frankly, refugees should not be lurking Reddit. 

In Canada, parties that run to get the Incumbents out of the office are usually the ones releasing their platform/convention declaration early. Besides, with the Incumbents most likely it will be the status quo or a slight modification of the status quo. So do not be surprised when you see many parties have more details than Liberals. Chances are Trudeau will release theirs later after the writ is dropped. 

**Liberals:**

Status quo. Previously Minister Hussen has commited to admitting 1 million from 2018 to 2020. We are at the final stage of that. It is expected that Canada will admit 340000 later next year.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/immigration-canada-2018-1.4371146

**CPC:**

[Main Source from Policy Declaration in 2018](https://cpcassets.conservative.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/03154936/00477c06063465c.pdf)

CPC is committed to:

> a fair, transparent and efficient process that earns the respect and confidence of Canadians
as well as of the international community;

> compassionate measures to assist in family reunification;
> ensuring that Canada is successful in encouraging skilled immigrants and their spouses
and children to make Canada their destination of choice;

> a clear, workable and efficient process for immigrants to obtain equivalency for their
international skills, training and experience;

> addressing the need for adequate long-term funding for settlement services providers; and

> upholding Canada’s humanitarian tradition of providing safe haven forrefugees.

As far as pilot programs for temporary workers, CPC is also committed to continuing pilot programs to address severe shortage in rural areas (p52). They are also committed to ensuring that TFWs receive the same protections. 

On Birthright Citizenship, the CPC will encourage the government to *fully eliminate birthright citizenship unless at least one of the parents is at least a PR.* (p54). 

Andrew Scheer also reiterated most of these in his Immigration speech. [Cliffnote can be found here](https://www.conservative.ca/cpc/andrew-scheers-immigration-plan/) and the [video here](https://www.conservative.ca/cpc/andrew-scheers-immigration-plan/). I cannot find a video with his speech that is not also part of a commentary. 

**NDP:**

[Main source](https://www.ndp.ca/communities?focus=13934157&nothing=nothing)


The NDP believes strongly in family reunification. They lashed out on the Liberals' failure to make sure the January family reunification went smoothly. They also want to remove the arbitrary cap. [Source.](https://www.ndp.ca/news/ndp-statement-parentgrandparent-sponsorship-application-system-failure) This is not new as previously during the Harper Government they also committed to the same fight. 

No specific yet on numbers, but they are committed to admitting people to where they are needed. 

**Green Party of Canada:**

[Source from Policy Page](https://www.greenparty.ca/en/policy/vision-green/people/rights/immigration)

This is the only party that actually calls the problem by name, Temporary Foreign Workers. They are committed to eliminating the program and to simply ensuring higher immigration to where labours are needed. 

On foreign skills recognition, the Greens will 

> eliminate valuation of foreign credentials

> Press professional societies to remove unnecessary barriers hindering the recognition of valid professional credentials of immigrants

> Ensure professionals being considered for immigration will have the licensing requirements for their professions clearly explained before entry. Landed immigrants with professional qualifications will be supported and given the opportunity to obtain Canadian licenses consistent with public safety;

On integration, the Greens will work with municipalities and provinces to improve the integration of new Canadians into the multicultural fabric of Canada.

**PPC:**

Recently Bernier had his immigration speech. He is the only one so far who brought in real numbers. [(Source)](https://www.peoplespartyofcanada.ca/speech_the_people_s_party_of_canada_position_on_immigration_and_multiculturalism)

On immigration levels, the PPC will admit only 100-150,000 per year. Important note that the PPC will double the proportion of economic immigrants and refugees from 26% to 50% so that the *absolute number* of economic immigrants and refugees will stay the same. 

They will also ensure new immigrants sit for a face-to-face interviews on mainstream Canadian values.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/ciqm4h/meta_political_parties_on_immigration/,"Thank you, this is exactly the sort of detailed summary I was looking for."

My sister is in 11th grade in Europe, and would like to go to university in Canada, with the goal of staying after her studies. 
My questions are a little all over the place because I know so little about the system. 

- What options are available to her? Can she apply for permanent residence while she’s in her 1st year of university? Under what program?

- what’s the difference between college and university, is it the same as in the US? (College gives 4 year degrees while universities have Masters and PHDs) 

- I believe there was a program that allowed students to apply for permanent residence after completing a special 1-2 year school program, but I think this was repealed? If not, is that a possibility for her?

- I don’t think she would qualify for Express Entry or PNP because her only advantage is that she speaks French, being so young and without work experience, is that right?

- Speaking of French, is there any advantages to studying in French/ living and applying in Québec?

I am just looking to put together a broad plan so she has an idea of what the process will be like.

aoovex,Meta,Urgent Advice Needed-Leaving Canada in three days!,"This is my second post on here and thank you all for all of the advice you've thus far given me! I have a tricky situation that I'll try to summarise quickly: 

I made a mistake when I wrote down my arrival date (actally arrived on 07/12/2018, but wrote down 08/12/18) and I did not learn of this mistake until I was already beyond my 6-month visitor visa. That said, I intend to apply for a working holiday visa, or at the very least, another 6-month visitor visa (I can easily prove that I have ties at home, plus sufficient funding to support myself while in Canada). 

So, here's the issue: I'm leaving Canada next Tuesday to go to Costa Rica for a month (work related) and being that my visitor status has already expired, some redditors have already expressed that it's pointless to go though the process of applying to restore my status as a visitor, considering my renewed status will effectively be nullified upon my departure. That said, I've already finished the application and all that is left to do is to pay the $300 fee and submit the application.

So, here's my question: 

Would  paying to reset my status before I leave the country, potentially reflect positively on my eligibility for entry, from the point of view of Canadian Immigration? I intend to apply for the working holiday visa while I'm in Costa Rica, and if that's unsuccessful, I will apply for a skilled worker visa (I'm highly educated and have already been granted this type of visa for The Netherlands and Germany in the past). Could resetting my status potentially help my eligibility for the working holiday, or at the very least for another visitor visa upon my return from Costa Rica? 

My objective is to show CBSA officials that this was an unfortunate oversight on my part and that I fully intend to do the right thing moving forward. The biggest concern I have is that my flight to Costa Rica is leaving out of Vancouver and I will be leaving my car and belongings with friends here in Canada. Even if I am unsuccessful in obtaining either a working holiday visa or a skilled migrant visa, I'm very worried that I will be flagged and unable to re-enter Canada upon returning, in which case I will be in quite the predicament to say the least!

j0tmbd,Express Entry,Advice from a Canadian Immigration veteran - Do your research,"Hi guys,

I've been lurking around this sub for months and I couldn't help it but notice a series of common mistakes many of you make when gathering information and resources to move to Canada.

I'm 21, but I consider myself a veteran when it comes to Canadian immigration. I started to look at how to move to Canada since I was 14 years old. Before Express Entry existed and LMIA's were called LMO.

Now, I graduated from a Canadian college a couple of months ago, and if everything goes well, I'll be applying for PR next month. With 0 work experience, a bachelor, or having taken the IELTS. How is that possible? *Because I did my research*, and hopefully by creating this post I'll convince you to do yours before resorting to an immigration agent.

That's all I wanted to say, it's a bit discouraging how many people post here without having done any research or taking the effort to go through the IRCC page, expecting to get easy answers while the truth is Canadian immigration is extremely complex and the different options to stay permanently in the country vary from one person to another.

**DO YOUR RESEARCH.**

Edit:

Thanks for the award! Since some people PM'd me asking among other things about the acronyms' meaning, here's a list of the most common used ones:

PR = Permanent Residence

PNP = Provincial Nominee Program

EE = Express Entry

ITA = Invitation to apply

CEC = Canadian Experience Class

FSW = Federal Skilled Worker

FST = Federal Skilled Trades

TFW= Temporary Foreign Worker

PGWP = Post-graduation work permit

DIP = Decision in Progress

WHV = Working Holiday Visa

YP = Young Professionals visa

LMIA = Labour Market Impact Assessment",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/j0tmbd/advice_from_a_canadian_immigration_veteran_do/,"Some of this advice is useful, some I disagree with. My thoughts:

\- most PNPs require some sort of connection to the province - a job offer, a Canadian degree, etc. The reality is if you're outside Canada, there is a low chance you'd be eligible for any (although worth looking into)

\- to avoid your point on picking the right province, focus on getting a NOC 0, A or B job. That's it. Why confuse yourself over PNPs you might not even need, if you're able to land a skilled job and go through Express Entry? This will save you time and money (see below)

\- ""Paper-based PNP programs have significantly less requirements than Express Entry"" - sure, but will take you twice as long. Maybe longer. You first need to apply for, and pay for, the PNP (some of which can take 6+ months to get). Then your paper-based PR application will take 15+ months to process. Instead, focus on graduating with good grades, get a skilled job asap and once you hit 1+ year of Canadian work experience, there is a very good chance of having a high enough EE score (depending on some factors such as language exam). 

\- agreed that some consultants are good, some are bad. Be very, very careful when selecting one and if you choose to use a consultant or lawyer, do your due diligence before giving them your money"

I wonder if my employment update prompted the office to have a look at my application and expedited the processing?

i8n5yz,Express Entry,"After one year of ineligibility, one provincial nomination, one work permit, nine months of waiting, and a Procedural Fairness letter, I'm finally a permanent resident","I completed my virtual landing interview yesterday and received the message in my IRCC account this morning that my application had been finalized and approved. Words cannot describe how relieved and elated I am after everything it took to get here!

Some background on my journey to PR:

I'm from the States. I began researching and working through the immigration process in early 2018. After taking the IELTS and getting my degree validated, I submitted my EE profile to the pool only to find out I wasn't eligible due to my lack of work experience. After doing more research I realized I wouldn't be able to apply for at least another year.

 I waited it out resubmitted my profile in mid 2019. I didn't have enough points to be selected straightaway but I got a Notification of Interest from Ontario and went through the Provincial Nomination process. While waiting on the decision on my nomination, I got a job offer and used the IEC Young Professionals program to get a work permit to come to Canada for a year. My nomination eventually went through and I submitted my PR application (without using a lawyer) in November 2019 after getting my ITA. Days after that, I drove across the border to Canada and started working. 

After not hearing from IRCC for a while, I requested GCMS notes to see what was going on with my application. I started getting worried by April because of the process being delayed by COVID. In early May 2020 I got a Procedural Fairness letter because I didn't include enough documentation on my student loans and the officer wasn't satisfied that I'd be able to bear the burden of my loans after moving to Canada (even though I'd let them know that I was already living in Canada). I hired a lawyer and they put together a pretty comprehensive case using some additional documentation I should have used in the first place. I sent that off to IRCC and waited.

At this point it'd become pretty well documented that they were mainly just processing inland applications, so I raised a webform in late July asking whether my application was being processed as inland or outland and attached a scan of my Ontario driver's licence as evidence that I do indeed live here. I received a generic response from them saying that they'd ""forwarded it to the responsible office"".

I started panicking since my permit expiration was approaching. I requested GCMS notes for a second time this past Sunday to see what was going on. Then yesterday morning I received an email from the Etobicoke office that served as my virtual landing! They just asked me to confirm when I first entered Canada to work, the last time I entered Canada, and my Canadian address. Earlier today I got the message that my application status had been updated and changed to approved, with an added Document Status field with information about my COPR document :) I'm still waiting on the actual COPR itself as it wasn't downloadable from the CIC website; my lawyer said it can take a few days for them to email it.

Edit: clarified some date ambiguities

Edit 2: I got my actual COPR document via email today, so it took 5 days in total from the day of my virtual landing to the day I got the COPR.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/i8n5yz/after_one_year_of_ineligibility_one_provincial/,"Congrat !

Brief analysis: relatively low number of people invited with a very very high invitation score (not surprising). It feels somehow anti-climactic and that this draw was just to appease everyone somewhat, given how few were invited.

I am overjoyed to report that my PR application has been approved!!!!!! I am overjoyed and have been crying happy tears for the last hour. 

I am thankful for this forum because someone here posted (sorry I can't remember your handle) about them contacting their local MP to expedite the application, which is what I did and I think it worked. I also have a job offer starting August 2021 and I asked my employed for an expedition letter and it was attached to my application. 

A bit of context: I am a health care professional (physician) and I wasn't able to work since July 2020 because of my immigration status. I had a visitor status since then. I applied through the CEC pathway. I retained an excellent immigration consultant that I would HIGHLY recommend in Edmonton.

yjf3vm,Express Entry,"After 3 years, I’m holding my PR card","Tl;dr After 3 years and 2 letters to the Minister of Immigration, I finally have my PR card. I’m probably going to go find a public piano and play it.

Long version: My first job after graduating college in 2018 was a position at UBC, so I moved here from New York. It felt like a good time to start putting out roots outside the US.

I immediately fell in love with the vibes and at least one girl, so I applied for my PR when I became eligible. The issue was COVID. Because I went back to the US during Covid, my application — though approved — was placed at the back of the queue.

I sent a lot of web forms (e.g., “do I need to buy a billboard in front of your office to get my paperwork finalized”), and a letter to Ahmed Hassan. Another one to his successor, Sean Fraser, finally did the trick. I got a personal response from his aide and a finalized application. And landed in March.

The card never came in the mail, though. But finally I got a call to come pick it up. 

My takeaway is that time and persistence are both required to make this process work. I have a lot of respect for people who immigrate from countries that aren’t the US or Europe, and have a much harder time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/yjf3vm/after_3_years_im_holding_my_pr_card/,Congrats!

iyx1wg,Express Entry,My 2-year love affair with Canada's Express Entry pool - ah the pool :),"Hello guys,

It's been a long and cold wait in the pool. Two years on and I don't seem to be moving and now I find myself clutching at straws in a desperate attempt to pull through as I languish in the dark abyss of unpicked profiles of Canada's fabled express entry system.

I chose Canada two years ago and completed my express entry profile in August 2018. My CRS score then was 424. I remember the cutoff then was 440. I had maxed out my IELTS (8.5) but lost points due to age - I was a very young and charming 36 back then with over 8 years of skilled experience. Also, since my wife never completed her graduation, adding her to my application hurt the score instead of helping boost it. Her IELTS score was an equal disaster (sorry, honey). Anyway, I waited for the score to come down but as we know, that never happened.

I was not desperate enough so I didn't really pay attention to PNP programs. Had I known that I qualified for an NOC that was in the in-demand list of Ontario, I'd have paid more attention to their Tech draws. My occupation fell under the NOC 2171 but had a large overlap in responsibilities under that of NOC 2172. After I came to my senses, I changed my NOC to 2172 to be eligible for Ontario's tech draws. That was almost a year ago and I'm still waiting.

In the meantime, I decided as many have before - to go the french way. I speak 4 languages already and I always wanted to learn French. So I thought what the heck, I'm good at languages and this could very well jack up my CRS score. I joined my nearest Alliance Française in Jan 2019.

I topped my class for each of the courses and quickly moved up the levels. I thought I was a Pro :) I had a lot of fun. A year and a half of attending classes twice a week along with holding down a full time job and tending to a small business, I found myself at level B1. So level 0 to level B1 isn't that bad even if it took more than a year, yeah? Well, turns out Canada rewards you by shaving a cool 5 points off your score every time it's your birthday! I've started to hate my birthdays now.

So here I am, I attempted the TEF exam in June 2020 and scored a graceful B1. It felt like I was able to save face but it just gave me 2 points while taking away 10 for the two birthdays I've miserably had during the time I was trying to french my way up the CRS ladder.

I know, you gotta have a B2 for it to be able to matter at all. I'm just tired. But yeah, I can't give up now, not at least for the love of the language. So I'm gonna keep going and hope to try again next year (minus 5 points, aargh!).

For the moment, I've done what I should've done two years ago - I removed my wife from my profile (sorry honey for kicking you out). Now my score's 427. It's shit, I know. But hey, it could make all the difference when the next Tech draw happens, what do you think? Besides that, I've also submitted my profile into the PNP systems of Quebec, Saskatchewan, PEI. Nothing yet.

By the way, the nuts at WES saw my 4 year Engineering + 2 year Masters as not 'master' enough and so I can't claim points for masters. I've now sent my credentials to CES at University of Toronto for evaluation hoping they'd be more lenient. Now you see those straws I'm clutching at? That's 7 more points right there.

Thanks guys, for putting up with my rant. I just feel like I'm at the end of my wits. My IELTS score expired and so I just gave another one (this time I got a 9) and I swore that it's the last time I'm taking that test (fingers crossed).

I feel like there are a lot of people like me who are hardworking, highly skilled and persevering enough to be able to make it in the beautiful land of Canada but are being hindered unnecessarily due to age. If this is not a good reason to look at other countries, then what is? 

I hope somebody in the Canadian government takes note (eh, Justin?).

thanks guys for your encouragement in advance and I would appreciate any piece of advice you may have for me. I hold the nationality of India and work and live in the UAE with my beloved wife and kids :)

God bless you all!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/iyx1wg/my_2year_love_affair_with_canadas_express_entry/,"Going from 0 to B1 is, what, 400 hours of study? If you could do that in a year, you can probably do the next 200 to get to B2. Good luck!"

We arrived wearing masks & gloves,  a stack of paperwork ready to go, and there were no issues with our self isolation plan.  There were some Canadians who arrived in the line without masks & plans, and they were subjected to quite a lot of scrutiny by the border agents.

Biggest issue was on the US side of the border, as I've had to leave a vehicle behind that I'm not sure when I can go back to get.

Canada seems sooooo open to immigrants from outside of Canada. It represents it self like that. But from inside the picture is totally different. Who is going to take responsibility for what immigrants have been through so far? The stress, anxiety and all that.

htni1x,Express Entry,Carpe Diem,"Hi guys! 

I just wanted to share my journey here on how I got my ""Canadian Dream""

My husband and I started applying last 2018. We were in Hong Kong at the time because of my husband's job. We saw that Canada was open for immigration and decided to apply. It was a long journey! We started gathering documents and taking the IELTS around July of 2018 and was able to submit our application December 2018 and got our ITA January 2019. 

When we got our ITA, I knew I would have to upgrade my skills to be able to have a career in Canada. My previous job was working in a call center as a trainer, teaching English.

I decided to study accounting and found a college in Canada that offers distance education to international students without an international student surcharge (I was able to pay local rates). The subjects I took were also accredited by a professional Canadian bookkeeping association. I am now on my way to becoming a ""Certified Bookkeeper"" in Canada it's like a CPA but for bookkeepers. 

Fast forward to a year later, November 2019. I landed in Canada. I was just about to finish my last subject in my bookkeeping certificate  and I started applying for jobs with the expected graduation date in my resume as December 2019. I landed a job before I even finished my bookkeeping certificate.

As March 2019 hit, my hours were cut as we mostly did bookkeeping for restaurants and because of COVID, restaurants were not doing too well. I didn't let that get me down. I started my own bookkeeping company and advertised my services as a virtual bookkeeper. I have now landed several clients and between my part time job bookkeeping for restaurants and my own bookkeeping clients, I feel like I'm doing very well. 

If my husband and I had waited to apply to come to Canada, or didn't act on the opportunity, I cannot imagine living in Hong Kong until now. Our visa in HK, depended on my husband's job. The HK protests, China taking over HK. Now, were in Canada as permanent residents. 

I guess the point of this post is, grab the opportunity to immigrate while you can, get through the process as quickly as possible. Some people ""age out"" of express entry. This would've been a very different post if we applied 6 months later than we did, we could still be stuck in HK right now due to the travel ban cause of COVID. Also, immigrating to Canada is the easy part. You have to think of what you're gonna do when you land and how you're going to make a life in Canada. And even though some things don't go your way, you have to keep fighting for your dream.

We are now Canadian Permanent Residents, Citizens in 2 years (counting down the days). My husband and I are also small business owners and contribute to our community. We love it here. And we love Canada for giving us the chance to have a better life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/htni1x/carpe_diem/,Wow could you tell me what school you took online Canadian courses with? I’m trying to get a teaching degree in the states but then I’m worried I will have to do a bunch of extra stuff in Canada.
14jkttx,Express Entry,Which is better? Staying in US on H1B vs staying in Canada with PR,"
Me and my spouse are engineers currently on H1B. Haven’t applied for green card yet and understand that we won’t be getting until at least 15 years. I had applied for Canadian PR for us both and it recently got approved. I like the stability of not having to worry about immigration in Canada but low pay, more expenses and limited opportunities don’t tempt me into moving. Has anyone tried this route? 

Please feel free to share your experience or thoughts",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/14jkttx/which_is_better_staying_in_us_on_h1b_vs_staying/,"As you can see from the previous comments, whether Canada or the US is a “better” place to live is going to be determined by your personal preferences: there is no single objective answer. 

However, I think it’s fair to say that PR status is objectively better and more stable than any work permit / visa. 

So it really comes down to your own personal preferences and goals:

1. Is NOT returning to your home country your number 1 priority? If so, taking the Canadian PR is your surest bet of avoiding that potentiality.

2. Income and cost of living comparisons (both can vary widely within either country). 

3. Politics and culture (again, while there are some nationwide “norms” that are different between the US & Canada, these both vary very widely within each country)

4. Weather - pretty much everywhere in Canada is cold; the US has much more variety 

5. Education options (for yourself or your family - once again, a lot of variety within each country)

Etc 

Everyone’s metric for what makes a place “good to live in” is going to be different. You just have to make a list of your own priorities and decide which option is most likely to allow you to accomplish them."

jp68dz,Express Entry,Express Entry Application Approved! Timeline and Deets below,"I got an email from my lawyer yesterday that I'd been approved as a permanent resident of Canada. We're now just waiting for IRCC to generate that final set of documents and instructions on how to get my PR card. I'm probably going to treat myself to a drink or two this weekend.

Honestly, my circumstances have put me in a very lucky place because I was born and raised in the Philippines but I also have a German passport and citizenship thanks to my mom being German.

And I'm also somehow lucky enough that when I was applying to work in companies in Canada (while still living in the Philippines) one company liked my demo reel and application enough to hire me in 2018 and that pretty much put everything into motion and I had to pack up and go quite suddenly.

To be fair, I already had a working holiday visa approved when I was applying to Canadian companies, but most of them pretty much just seenzoned my application since I had a Philippine address and phone number. I was also sOMEHOW lucky enough to have a landlord agree to take me on as a tenant in her basement suite.

But yea, my timeline is as follows:

**March 2018**\- applied for Working Holiday Visa

**April 2018-** took CELPIP test even if it wasn't required yet but since I knew it would be needed for a PR application, I arranged for it anyway and got scores 11 Listening; 11 Reading; 8 Writing; 8 Reading

**May 2018**\- Working Holiday visa approved

**September 2018**\- activated Working Holiday and started working for a company in the animation industry (which I have a degree in)

**August 2019**\- activated Young Professional visa (which required biometrics and medical) (application/lawyer was sponsored by my employer, yes, the same company)

**October 2019**\- got in touch with the same lawyer (and paying out of pocket since employer was only willing to sponsor work permits) and started prepping documents, contacting WES, etc

**January 2020** \- submitted profile with a score of 510

**February 2020**\- received ITA

**March 2020**\- submitted application (before my CELPIP scores were due to expire the following month); Also had to apply for a new German passport because mine was going to expire October 2020.... then everything changed when Covid attacked

**June 2020** \- finally got new passport (after paying express processing for it lmao) and updated PR application

Final Decision - COPR June 8th, 2021

All I can say is I never sent any mails to ask IRCC about anything, I just think it increases work load so I just waited patiently which was really difficult to do as I lost my Work permit(got laid off and could not apply for open work permit) and was on temporary residence till I got my work permit back during the new policy on Jan27th. Even though watching and reading a lot of threads about people's timeline was somewhat helpful, It dint matter as everyone case will be processed eventually some will take more time than others and there is no point in comparing and having so much anxiety(easier said than done).

(Just to add my brother applied two months before me who had a similar timeline and got his COPR one month ago and his PR card arrived in two weeks, But at the time he got his application approved it was not online, so he got a phone call from IRCC to confirm his address and he had to send a picture for his card)

lwaggh,Express Entry,I’ve had enough. I’ll no longer stay in the EE pool.,"I’ve been in the pool for almost two years now, the scores back then were in the 440s. So right before I entered the pool with a 450+ score. The average scores skyrocketed. 

Express entry is way too competitive now. And not gonna lie, a bit stress inducing for me. 

I’ve also started learning French, I’m currently studying French B1. But it’s quite difficult to balance work life and a student life simultaneously. I will continue with French, but at my own pace, because I fell in love with the language and I came too far to give up on it. 

But for my sanity, I’ll try to immigrate somewhere else. Sometimes it’s better to shift your focus elsewhere rather than holding on to a fine string of hope.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/lwaggh/ive_had_enough_ill_no_longer_stay_in_the_ee_pool/,"Scores increased steadily due to competition and reached a natural plateau at around 470, which is essentially the highest score someone can get with a master's but without a connection to Canada or French (though there are outliers who have PhDs, perfect English scores, etc.). This plateau used to be around 440 where the highest average education was a bachelor's and not a master's. This was bound to happen as demand (number of candidates) outweighs supply (number of invitations).

If you can get to a high-intermediate level of French, you may still be in the running to have a competitive score (though without knowing the details of your background it's hard to say for sure). I would say if you're learning French anyway, it may be good to re-calculate your score assuming you have a higher level (to get the 50 point bonus)."
13glxpk,Express Entry,PSA for those who get PR application approved but have travel booked in the near future,"Hi all, 

I just want to share my experience with this specific scenario as it is not very well documented online. Basically, I got my PR approved a couple of weeks ago (woohoo!), but I had booked travel out of Canada for a cousin's wedding in Asia for the end of May. In case, some of you don't know, the process when you get approved is: **PR is approved -> PR portal confirmation email sent -> You reply to email stating you are in Canada (and some other details) -> IRCC sends you portal credentials -> You confirm your status in Canada in the portal and sit tight waiting for your PR card**. I understand that once portal login credentials are sent, you have a short deadline (7 days) to enter in the information.

The general, safe advice I found was to just stay in Canada, but I really didn't want to give up the trip and money so I called IRCC. They told me that I could respond to the PR portal confirmation email stating my travel plans and when I would be back in the country. They responded within a few days requesting I reply back to the same email thread with proof of my return such as a boarding pass and/or passport stamps. Once I send this over, they will resume the processing of my PR application as normal. 

Hope this helps someone that might come across a similar situation!

12u7gi9,Express Entry,Dispelling misinformation about Express Entry invitation draws,"There seems to be a lot of misinformation and false assumptions when it comes to Express Entry invitation draws, so I wanted to provide some resources for people to understand better how the invitation scores work and why no one can predict what the next score will be.

#How the draws work
First, the invitation scores are not random, and IRCC does not choose the score. They choose how many candidates they want to invite, and under which program(s). Based on this, the score is generated.

For example: IRCC chooses to invite 2,500 candidates under all programs (“no program specified”). Whatever CRS score the 2,500th candidate from the top in the pool has is the invitation score. This also takes into account the cut-off score, where the older profile takes priority. If more than one candidate has the same score as the 2,500th candidate, any profiles newer than theirs will not be invited.

IRCC does not directly state how many candidates they will invite in advance. The closest information we have is the [publicly-available]( https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/notices/supplementary-immigration-levels-2023-2025.html) details of the total number of permanent residents IRCC expects to invite over the course of the year.

#Why we can’t predict the next invitation scores
- Profiles are constantly in flux. New profiles get created, old profiles expire, profile CRS scores increase with higher language scores or more employment points, and profile CRS scores decrease with age, losing employment points, etc. If the pool shows that there are x number of candidates with scores above 500, that number could be different one hour from now.

- IRCC does not publish how many candidates they will invite until the draw itself.

- The draw schedule is unpredictable (in recent times). Draws are (were) *normally* about every two weeks. But this isn’t an official mandate by IRCC. They can hold draws whenever they choose, and we have seen this in recent times. 

- The implementation of Bill C19 can occur at any time, and this may drastically alter the invitation scores and the whole invitation process. Many have falsely assumed this would target specific NOC codes, but the actual wording of the bill is “groups” that can be targeted at the Minister’s discretion. This is incredibly vague (on purpose) and could include anything from French speakers, to people who have Canadian education, to (yes) in-demand occupations, or any other “group” the Minister wants to target.

As such, saying that the scores are “going down”, or that at the rate of draws the scores should be as low as 470 by summer based on two recent scores of 485 and 481 (for example) is a false assumption. The **only** thing anyone has to go on to “predict” the next draw score are to look at the [previous draw scores]( https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/ministerial-instructions/express-entry-rounds.html) and trying to find a trend. But even this is not reliable, for the reasons mentioned above.

The best way you can prepare yourself against the unpredictability of the invitation scores is to stay knowledgeable about the process and find ways to increase your score in the meantime to increase your likelihood of being invited in future draws. Good luck.

Other resources:

- [CRS calculator]( https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/crs-tool.asp) – despite what people may say, this is accurate.

- [CRS points grid]( https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/criteria-comprehensive-ranking-system/grid.html) – you can see exactly how points are allocated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/12u7gi9/dispelling_misinformation_about_express_entry/,"> Many have falsely assumed this would target specific NOC codes, but the actual wording of the bill is “groups” that can be targeted at the Minister’s discretion.

This is an example of coping mechanism for sure. Especially if accompanied with crafting NOC groups that include the poster's occupation. I cope a lot too, that's just what we do. Don't take it as an insult, but rather an invitation to get back to reality and see that as of now nobody knows. Time are better spent in working within the current point system and seeing where one could improve. If you could think ""IT/Tech must be in it"", I could also say ""but IT-oriented PNP have always existed, you would think targeted occupations would be for occupations not already addressed/targeted already."" 

I know this sub is very moderated and I do not always agree to the finer points, but yea a lot of these speculating just lead to people coping or being super on edge.

* IRCC Permanent Residence Confirmation Portal (ETOB) email: November 17th 2020
* No update in the profile even after recieving the email today. Eligibility and Criminality still says under review and processing.

I am almost sure this means I got the PR 100% but because this is so new I cannot find a lot of examples in forums about confirmations like this. I read in Canada Visa forum Another woman got the same email as I did today but earlier in the day, and after she replied to it she got the link to the portal today as well and uploaded her picture and verified her address. I think because I replied to mine around 5:30 I will receive the email for the portal tomorrow.

Will keep you up to date.

Also here some info about the portal:

[https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/pr-confirmation-portal.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/pr-confirmation-portal.html)

It does say: Once we approve your application, we’ll

* send you an invitation to confirm
   * if you want to use the portal
   * your email address
   * all email addresses for each person on your application
* create an account for you (you can’t create one yourself)
* send another email, after you confirm the above, with a link to the portal and instructions on how to sign in with your username and a temporary password

So I doubt they would send this to someone who is not approved. I am so happy! :)

Perhaps the most important factor is which antiretroviral medications you take.

Lots of HIV-positive people immigrate to Canada on a regular basis. At one point it was harder but the government has worked to make it easier since about 2018.

>A 40-year‑old female applicant to the Provincial Nominee Program, who intends to live in Toronto, Ontario, has HIV. Without medication, the applicant would develop acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and become ill. The applicant takes the medication Atripla to treat her infection and to protect her immune system. She also has regular appointments with a doctor who specializes in HIV, and she gets laboratory tests.

>The total cost of health and social services for this applicant is $16,775 per year (or $83,877 over 5 years). This cost would not exceed the cost threshold of $19,812 per year.

That link also provides other links that will help you see how much your drugs will cost in various provinces. Finally, I think the annual excessive cost threshold for 2021 will be in the rough range of $22,000 (it goes up by a thousand or so each year)."

Hello Everyone:

I believe the following information will be helpful to those looking to immigrate to Canada through a program run under the Express Entry system.

For those in a hurry the key take-away is that details continue to remain scarce regarding changes to Express Entry, however, the recently proposed legislative amendments submitted to Parliament seem to indicate that an occupational based ranking component will likely become, in some way, an element of the Express Entry system. However, the scope and timeline for these changes continues to remain unclear.

Please see further details below:

**A.	General Background**

Budget 2021 announced the Government of Canada’s intent to introduce **amendments** to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act to further streamline the Express Entry System by providing the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship with authority to use Ministerial Instructions to **help select candidates** who best meet Canada’s **labour market** needs.

Without much additional information the only real take-away at that time was that ‘changes to the Express Entry system are coming,’ however, the exact scope and content was unclear.

**B.	Parliamentary Developments**

The aforementioned amendments are now being debated in Parliament.

Bill C-19 is an omnibus finance bill which has passed first and second readings at the House of Commons on April 28, 2022, and May 10, 2022, respectively. Bill C-19 is now being presented before the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance.

You can download the full text of Bill C-19 and you can track the bill’s progress through Parliament on the LegisInfo website:

•	[https://www.parl.ca/legisinfo/en/bill/44-1/c-19](https://www.parl.ca/legisinfo/en/bill/44-1/c-19)

For the purposes of Express Entry the relevant section of Bill C-19 is Division 23 (pages 370 to 373) – see PNG images above.

**C.	Existing Legislative Framework**

The invitation to apply system found in Express Entry is based on Division 0.1 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act:

**•	Division 0.1 of IRPA:** [https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/i-2.5/page-2.html#h-274208](https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/i-2.5/page-2.html#h-274208)

Section 10.3 under Division 0.1 is of particular importance to Express Entry hopefuls as it delegates power to the Minister to structure the entire system  – key points include:

(e) the **criteria** that a foreign national must meet to be eligible to be invited to make an application;

(h) the **basis on which** an eligible foreign national may be **ranked** relative to other eligible foreign nationals;

(i) the **rank** an eligible foreign national must occupy to be invited to make an application in respect of a class referred to in an instruction given under paragraph (a);

(j) the **number of invitations** that may be issued within a specified period, including in respect of a class referred to in an instruction given under paragraph (a);

Ministers then use this delegated power to **draft and issue the particulars of the system in Ministerial Instructions (MIs)**. The core idea behind this delegation of powers is that immigration is constantly growing, changing and adapting, and so, something more nimble and responsive is needed than traditional legislation to respond to immigration related matters.

By way of example here are the current MIs for Express Entry:

•	**Current MIs for Express Entry:** [https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/i-2.5/page-2.html#h-274208](https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/i-2.5/page-2.html#h-274208)

And here is a link that shows the **9 previous versions** of these MIs which were all issued in just a 6-year period:

•	**Previous MIs for Express Entry:** [https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/ministerial-instructions/express-entry-application-management-system.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/ministerial-instructions/express-entry-application-management-system.html)

j5nixf,Express Entry,Biometrics call today. GTA,"Just wanted to let people know I got my call today at exactly 9:15 in the morning. They knew I was in the GTA but let me know I could got to any location in any nearby city, they mentioned cities like Brampton, Scarborough, Hamilton, Ottawa, Kitchener, etc. I told them I want Toronto, and they had appointments available all day Tomorrow and I could pick any time I wanted (maybe I was their first call of the day), he also mentioned that if it’s too soon I can pick another day, but I have been waiting since April so there was no way I am waiting a single extra day for this, so I am going tomorrow.



To sum up an to add extra info:

-got my BIL first week of April

-got call today at 9:15 am 

-all the slots for next day appointment were available for me to choose any time I wanted.

-because of the availability for next day appointments, it makes me think they start calling around 9am, I could be wrong so definitely keep sleeping with your phone next to you.

-they call from a No Caller Id number

-they did not ask me for my UCI 

-they asked me to confirm my postal code

-i have to go with my passport and printed,expired, BIL. 

-you can pick any nearby location, not just the GTA 

-they offer next day appointments in Toronto, so no need to make long trips just to get an appointment quicker, in case you are in the GTA 

-the callers are working from home, the dude apologized for his dog barking, not really relevant but shows they are not back in the office yet. 



I saw a post of a person who got their BIL at the beginning of March, and got the appointment last week. Therefore, it took them a week to finish appointments for the entire month, as I got mine at the beginning of April. So you can kinda calculate when you will get your call.

Hope this info calm some of your nerves, the call definitely calmed mine.

thnhfh,Express Entry,FSW application approved after 2 years,"I’ve been following this sub for the past 4 years, and I want to share my experience with you all.

I waited 25 months in-Canada to get my CoPR under the FSW program. CRS of 486: 31yo, single, with a master’s degree, did a one-year college program in Canada, a sibling in Canada and 8 years of work experience. Passed the IELTS after 4 attempts and got the score that I needed after EOR in the last attempt.

I enrolled a two-year university program in Canada after the one-year college program since I didn’t want to risk my stay in Canada by having a PGWP of one year. It was an expensive and tough decision but, in the end, it worked out well since Covid hit and I probably would have lost my work permit in that year without getting a job. My work field is in healthcare and without a practice license I would not have been able to get a NOC A or B job. My advice is if you need to study in Canada do a two-year or a master’s or PhD.

Here is a summary of my application:

•ITA: Jan. 8, 2020 

•AOR:  Feb. 15, 2020 

•Biometrics completed: March 3, 2020 

•Then COVID hit in March 2020 and the nightmare began. 

•Ghost update in February 2021!! 

•Medicals passed in May 2021 (I had my medicals done in March 2020 the week before Covid was declared a pandemic). 

•Later, I requested 2 GCMN notes, and they showed that the process was stuck in Background/Security check 

•Sent a Letter to PM in November 2021 

•They emailed back saying that IRCC will “…expect action on your file soon” in November 2021 

•IRCC contacted me and requested (again) Police certificates and Schedule A form on January 11th, 2022. 

•Ghost update on February 28th, 2002. •PR Approved March 7th, 2022 •CoPR March 10th, 2022

Right now, Im waiting to receive my PR card in the mail.

It was a lot of sacrifice and I have only shared what refers to the PR. The past 3 years I have been a mature international student, and then later got a PGWP which I received in August 2021. I think I have invested a lot of time and money in this journey, but I finally made it.

There were days when I was not the most positive and almost gave up and move back to my home country, but I’m thankful that family and friends gave me a lot of support to keep my goals in sight from far away, especially during Covid times.

I hope this give some sense of purpose to some and for those that are beginning their immigration journey I will just say that always have faith and don't despair.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/thnhfh/fsw_application_approved_after_2_years/,Thanks for sharing and congratulations :)

# Individuals approved for permanent residence may travel to Canada as of June 21

## Backgrounder

Immigration remains crucial to addressing Canada’s longstanding demographic challenges and labour market shortages, and it will be a vital part of Canada’s post-pandemic economic recovery. Starting June 21, 2021, any foreign national who holds a valid Confirmation of Permanent Residence (COPR) may travel to Canada.

Under the previous rules, foreign nationals who held a valid COPR issued on or before March 18, 2020, were exempt from Canada’s travel restrictions. Those who held a valid COPR issued after March 18, 2020, could only come to Canada if they met another exemption or were coming from the US to settle permanently in Canada.

### Helping applicants with expired and expiring COPRs

A COPR’s validity, which can last for up to one year, is tied to the applicant’s passport and their immigration medical examination. However, many applicants were not able to travel to Canada before their COPRs expired due to the travel restrictions or other COVID-19 related considerations. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has been working with applicants who were already exempt from the travel restrictions to reissue them a COPR. For applicants with expired COPRs issued after March 18, 2020, more information on when and how to obtain a new COPR will soon be available on IRCC’s website.

Individuals whose COPR has expired **should not book flights or attempt to travel to Canada** until they receive a new COPR from IRCC.

### Safe and gradual arrival of new permanent residents in Canada

The Government of Canada’s top priority is the health and safety of Canadians. All people travelling to Canada, including those approved for permanent residence, must comply with the COVID-19 health measures and requirements upon arriving in Canada. All travellers must follow the [flying to Canada requirements checklist](https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/flying-canada-checklist) or [driving to Canada requirements checklist](https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/driving-canada-checklist).

The changes to the travel restrictions complement the [temporary pathway to permanent residence](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2021/04/new-pathway-to-permanent-residency-for-over-90000-essential-temporary-workers-and-international-graduates.html) for those already hard at work in Canada, to ensure we continue to have the labour force needed for our economic recovery. While permanent residence applicants in Canada will help bolster our more immediate labour market needs, successful applicants abroad need time to make arrangements and uproot their life before coming to settle in Canada, particularly in our current environment where many may not feel safe to travel right now. By allowing more time for reasonable numbers of new immigrants to settle in Canada and begin their integration, we can better prepare for Canada’s economic future.

Permanent residents are also likely to have supports in place once they arrive here—family members, supportive employers and resettlement agencies for refugees—and the means to ensure they comply with public health measures.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/o5cg17/individuals_approved_for_permanent_residence_may/,What about those of us waiting for almost 2 years to recieve COPR? Any news on those?
kpsbeu,Express Entry,CELPIP- Preparation and Test Experience,"Hello all, I'm writing this hoping to help people who're taking the CELPIP test soon or are thinking of it. I couldn't find much information earlier when I searched for it a couple of months back on reddit, and I think this post could provide at least some basic guidance to potential test takers. 

Background: I'm an Indian citizen on a student visa in the US since 3 years. I've a M.S degree in a STEM program. My first language is Gujarati.

My scores: 12,12,11,11 (Listening, Reading, Writing, Speaking). All sections have a maximum score of 12.

**Why take CELPIP compared to IELTS?**

Okay, so there's nothing like one test is better or easier than the other. Or at least I cannot say it for sure since I've not taken IELTS. My reasons for taking CELPIP were that first, I prefer taking a fully computerized test rather than some components in person (like in IELTS). Second, I don't trust my handwriting enough to do my writing section on paper. Also, I've taken TOEFL earlier for my MS admission process, which was fully computerized and I had scored well in that (115/120). 

If you're more comfortable speaking to a person rather than in a microphone, or you feel you can focus better in the reading section by getting to underline keywords in the passage, you should probably go for IELTS and not CELPIP. I've heard IELTS is much simpler than CELPIP and now I do have a reason to believe that, considering CELPIP's complexity vs TOEFL. HOWEVER, this is based on what I've heard from IELTS takers and not my own experience. 

**How much time is enough to prepare for CELPIP?**

This is again a subjective question, depending on how often you speak English in your daily life and how is your grammar in general. I personally studied for 20-25 hours in total (I'm a working guy and this left me really stressed as I thought it's not enough). However, I realize if you've prior experience of taking a similar test, 50 hours are more than sufficient to take the CELPIP test with confidence. If you work or study or live in an English environment, half of it is enough. 

**How to prepare for the test?**

I used the Free Accelerate videos on the official CELPIP website to first familiarize myself with the type and number of questions per section, the approximate time available per question, and the like. They also have a few questions in between. They're a little simpler than the actual ones on the test, but it gives a good idea of the test format and how the screen is going to look like in the actual test. Next, I did a free test with separate sections, that is, I chose to take up each section individually rather than take up the whole test at once. We get two free tests, by the way. I found it easier to identify my strengths and weaknesses that way. For example, you may breeze through the reading section but might find the listening part tough to crack. Important thing: The difficulty level of these practice tests is very, very similar to the actual test. So it's an excellent tool to know where you stand. 

Once you've isolated the parts you feel you need to work on more, search CELPIP on YouTube and you should get a lot of videos where you can extract the practice questions. (For me it was Speaking, as it had videos and analytical thinking involved and I felt it's unnecessarily tough. It tests your critical thinking ability more than speaking, and that sort of thing requires practice). Once you've practiced, go to the second test. 

If by the second test you're not getting the desired scores/performance, you should buy the 4 or 6 additional tests available on their website- remember, spending 50-75$ now and ensuring your success is better than retaking the test by spending an extra 275$ and stressing about it. Don't skip the sections you were good at in the earlier test though, you need to keep practicing. 

**Test experience in terms of difficulty?**

I found that suddenly I had to rush through some of the questions, because the time limit is per question (I think it varies but something like 30s for the listening section questions) instead of time per section. So I'd advise you to practice with a timer so you're prepared for it. Similarly, practice with a timer for the Speaking section, it gets done with really quickly. If you can complete your writing section early, it's good as you can get out of the exam room and drink water and calm down before the extremely fast and intense speaking section. It sure helped me. Don't click submit though, else the speaking section will start. Remember, you don't get any official break in the test, you've to create one yourself by completing a section early and letting the timer run. 

**Tips and strategies?**

I'd say focus on strategic note taking for the listening and speaking sections and don't just trust your memory, always practice like you're taking the actual test. Always address the question/questions asked- especially in the reading section. Don't veer off topic just to maximize words or your recording time, it makes your scores go down. Try to complete your sections in Reading and Writing early so you've time to verify your answers and grammatical mistakes.

1521q5v,Express Entry,PR Application Refused. What can we do?,"My gf was notified that her PR application (under CEC) was refused. The reason was that one of her work experiences letters did not contain the list of duties and therefore the officer stated that he/she was not convinced that she performed the actions described in her NOC. 

We understand this was a mistake on her end as the application clearly states that work experience letters must have a list of her duties and responsibilities; however, we would like to know what is the appropriate route on this. Does she needs to start the process again (aka profile creation) or is it possible to send over an updated letter via web form? 

Fortunately, she still has some time of PGWP validity and a good CRS score, but it would be great if someone could shed light on this.

mrbbq6,Express Entry,"For CEC prospective applicants, you don't have to worry about missing out on the temporary new international graduate stream","Since the program allows for students with college, uni, and grad school degrees to apply, it's safe to assume that the 40,000 international graduate stream quota will be filled up pretty quickly, leaving most of us still as CEC prospectives 

Canada has already sent out 50,000 invitations as of today, and with the new stream, we will have reached 140,000 people by May. Although you might be feeling the FOMO, Canada's goal this year is to accept 401,000 new PRs. In other words, they will not be able to meet their promised PR quotas at this rate, which leads me to believe that they will either send out a second and third wave of mass invitations (20,000+) with qualifications of extremely low CRS scores, accept an increasing number of people per round in the second half with lower-ish CRS scores (low 400s), or initiate a second, reduced round of invitations for international graduates/essential workers.

Although, if you're aiming for CEC, I don't know how the upcoming rounds of FSW invitations will change this: I wouldn't be surprised if we see a huge invitation go out for people who are waiting for the FSW stream to open up. If so, CEC invitations may remain constant a \~5000 with CRS cut-offs in the low-to-mid 400s.

tldr: Don't worry, just have your IELTS/CELPIP done asap to be able to capitalize on future opportunities. Canada is going to be extremely generous with PR invitations this year and you never know what they're planning to roll out down the line.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/mrbbq6/for_cec_prospective_applicants_you_dont_have_to/,"As someone with 280ish points, max celpip scores and a year's skilled work experience in canada, I hope that you're right."

That's pretty weird considering a lot of people have PGWP expiring. Does anyone know why this is happening or if IRCC has a plan for PGWP holder/CEC applicants? The lack of information and uncertainty isn't fun.....",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/11gdcty/cec_why_are_they_ignoring_us/,"The exact reason is not known because they DO NOT COMMUNICATE AT ALL about what the hell they plan to do or what is going on. This irritates me more and I am sure other people as well that the communication from them is severely lacking. 

If people would have known that they were basically going to screw over CEC candidates they might have looked towards other options early on but with PGWPs expiring everyday and some people who wanted to go through CEC pathway are in a rough spot. LMIAs are not straightforward to get. 

I personally would have been fine with either continued regular CEC draws or PGWP extended to mid 2024 but again we do not know if they even plan on doing anything. Worst part is just last year they announced they are brining regular draws back from June 2022 and now again the same crap."

One of the reasons is that Job Bank must be used when advertising a position for an LMIA. In theory, a qualified Canadian citizen or PR sees the ad, applies, and is hired by the employer. In practice, the employer often already has a foreign worker in mind for the position and will not consider a citizen or PR even if they are qualified. As such, if you see a position showing certain information such as explicitly stating that English is the required language of work or the wages are at the *exact* wages according to the Job Bank wages for that position, you can tell that the ad is for an LMIA and that the employer may not in practice be willing to actually hire for it."

I don't think my case was normal as my wife and I are from 2 different countries, and had to provide police clearance from 6 different countries.

* IELTS & WES assessment completed in Feb/March 2019
* Profile completed for EE 1 April 2019
* ITA 10 April 2019
* Police clearance (6 countries) April/May/June 2019 (don't be a fool like me, and only start these after your ITA. It can be a very lengthy process, and this was the only thing I needed lawyers for so start before you apply)
* EE application completed and submitted 14 June 2019
* Biometrics request 19 July 2019, and completed approx. a week later
* Message sent to Immigration Canada via portal approx. 15 January 2020, asking for an update. Response received in under 1 week
* Request for case notes approx 30 January 2020 (still not yet received)
* COPR received and request for Passport 6 Feb and passport couriered 7 February 2020 from WA USA to Ontario CA
* Passport received back in WA USA 19 February 2020 (really surprised at the quick turn around time here
* Planning on a soft landing in March 2020, with hard landing around the 3rd quarter of 2020.

My wife and I did not use a lawyer, except to help expiate police clearances in 2 foreign countries. I have not followed the draws super closely since then, but it looks to me like that since we received an ITA the numbers have not again come down to the point where would have received another invitation had we not gotten in when we did. This is relevant as my mother passed away right as we received the ITA, and we were also completely unprepared to receive the ITA so quickly, so I seriously considered not accepting and going back into the draw pool. Glad I didn't, but it was hard getting all that was required in 60 days while dealing with my family.

by15cf,Express Entry,Likely score of 441. Best options?,"[Since I'm being forced out of the United States](https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/buesue/denial_by_uscis_for_140k_salary_software_engineer/), I'm exploring the possibility of migrating to Canada. I'm 29 years old. I have a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science (from a well-ranked U.S. university), and work experience in the U.S. (in New York City).

~~Assuming I get perfect English scores~~ *EDIT:* I got my *IELTS* (English test) [results](https://i.redd.it/mbihh1kzf5331.png), and I have near-perfect scores (*with 9.0 in Reading, 9.0 in Listening, 8.0 in Writing, and 8.5 in Speaking*), which puts me in the highest [CLB 10](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/standard-requirements/language-requirements/test-equivalency-charts.html) language proficiency band, giving me the *maximum* *number of points for English*.

Altogether, I score **441 points**, per the [**CRS tool**](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/crs-tool.asp). But that's not quite enough to guarantee being able to migrate.

***What are my best options, for increasing my score?*** *Have I missed anything below?*

# Scoring Possibilities

I found that I can increase my score the following ways:

* With a Job or PNP:
   * With a job offer with LMIA: **491** (extra points = ***50***)
   * With a provincial nomination: **1041** (extra points = ***600***)
   * With one year of work experience in Canada: **494** (extra points = ***53***)
* With More Education:
   * With a post-graduate certificate/diploma from outside Canada: **474** (extra points = ***33***)
      * With a post-graduate certificate/diploma *from Canada*: **489** (extra points = ***48***)
   * With a Master’s degree from outside Canada: **481** (extra points = ***40***)
      * With a Master’s degree *from Canada*: **511** (extra points = ***70***)
   * Learning French to CLB/NCLC Level 7: **483** (extra points = ***42***)

Achieving any one of the items I've listed above, would *guarantee* being able to immigrate to Canada.

**So what's the easiest** ***and fastest*** **option for me here?**

Are there any other ways to immigrate besides the options listed above?

# Anywhere is Great — How hard is it to get a provincial nomination?

**I'm willing to move to any place** in Canada (except Quebec). I'd be overjoyed if I could move to Ontario, British Columbia, or the Atlantic provinces. Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta are also great. Even Yukon, Nunavut, and the NT are fine (for a bit) – if I'm allowed to move to elsewhere in Canada later on.

How hard is it to get a provincial nomination, *if I'm willing to settle down and live* ***anywhere*** \-- even a remote province?

# How hard is getting a LMIA-supported job offer?

I work in software development, and I'm pretty good at it.

I don't think it would be hard for me to find a tech job in Canada.

But what I'm concerned about is the LMIA. ***How hard is it to find a company that'll do it?***

According to [VisaPlace](https://www.visaplace.com/blog-immigration-law/temporary-foreign-workers-2/lmia-processing-time-temporary-foreign-worker-program/), it could take as little as 10 days to process, if I get a [high-wage job](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/foreign-workers/median-wage/high.html) offer.

An LMIA-supported job offer would grant me an additional 50 points, which would assure an ITA for PR.

# What sorts of certificates/diplomas count?

I found it strange that your language, education, and work experience is *counted* ***twice***, both under ""Core/Human capital factors"" and ""Skill transferability factors"" in CRS. Having just an extra certificate or diploma on top of your Bachelor's degree, gets you classified under ""*two or more certificates, diplomas, or degrees*"", adds 8 points under the core factors, and *most surprisingly,* ***doubles*** your skills transferability ""language proficiency and education"" score from 25 to 50. So an extra certificate/diploma is worth an additional **33** points -- which also assure an ITA.

What is the *easiest certificate/diploma* one can get, that would count? I assume it's the organization performing your ECA decides whether it counts, and I've read they can be a bit arbitrary with their evaluations, so I want to be certain with this. Has anyone gotten points for their certificate or diploma? If so, what sort of certificate/diploma did you have?

# Slightly Worried

I'm slightly worried that the Conservative Party of Canada could win the [election in October](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Canadian_federal_election), and then possibly reduce the number of people allowed to immigrate, which would likely have the effect of dramatically increasing the minimum CRS score required. ☹ As such, I want to get permanent residency in Canada as quickly as possible, and don't want to leave anything up to chance. After having lived for 10+ years in the U.S., [**I'm suffering the horrific consequences**](https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/buesue/denial_by_uscis_for_140k_salary_software_engineer/) of U.S. conservatives' hatred for immigrants. I don't want to get uprooted, and forced to leave my home, leave *my friends and community*, due to xenophobia, all over again. It's psychologically devastating, and just *really really* sucks overall. Canada is the country that's closest *culturally* to the U.S., so it's my first choice. It seems like a good country that welcomes immigrants, and one where I can put some roots down. Having permanent residency would eliminate the possibility of what happened to me in the U.S. happening in Canada, and I'd finally have some semblance of stability in my life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/by15cf/likely_score_of_441_best_options/,"So sorry about what's going on in USA right now. It's hard to believe you can live somewhere for 10 years, working in a highly skilled profession, and not be allowed to remain there. 

Canada has one of the most generous economic immigration programs in the world. The government understands that immigration of skilled workers is important for the country's economy. Even if the Conservatives win the election later this year, I can't see the Express Entry system changing too much. Because it's so generous, there is obviously high demand and this has gradually pushed the minimum CRS scores up. 

May I ask your age and your citizenship?"

481 is good but not a certainty while PNP is certain. Some people may not want to wait.

Obviously if you have an option to wait till 481 is hit, you should wait. 


My personal opinion : 481 will be hit if they invite 7k people in one round. If they continue 3500, it may not be as easy.

Well, it really depends on where you are coming from. If you are coming from a 3rd world country , yes it's a step up. Canada is not anymore the place that used to be 10-15 years ago. High cost of living, collapsing health care, high housing prices are the problems currently the country is facing. Vancouver and Toronto have a very high housing prices and it's really hard to get a house or a condo in these cities. The country is heavily invested in real estate and completely ignored innovation for years. Health care system is running at the brink and it's getting worse day by day.  

Now the Pros.

1. Great friendly people. 
2. It's beautiful country
3. Fresh air
4. Public funded healthcare 
5. Border to the united states

Create a new CRA account so that you can see your tax returns and documents. They will automatically merge this new account with your old one.

And pretty much hang up on me.

I was able to make a call a few months ago regarding an address change (because the website was not allowing me to do it for some reason, so I had to call). Is there any other number I can use to contact IRCC regarding a status update?

Its been well over a year since any correspondence regarding my PR application, last I heard they asked for more medical information which I promptly replied (Jan 2020) and then nothing. I successfully applied Aug 2019 and I'm still waiting.

Its so incredibly frustrating to wait this long, I know that I'm no position to complain since I'm a temporary resident but I've had to extend my work visa to remain in Canada in 2020 while waiting for PR, and now probably will have to do it again as that is only valid until May of this year.

It's very unfortunate that the system glitch has put you in this situation.

However, it is essential to face reality and make decisions accordingly. IRCC will not change their policies or provide an exception.

As of January 11, 2023, there are 243,255 people in the Express Entry pool and 21,816 have scores above 480.

Considering they will invite 5,500 biweekly from the recent draw, it will take a minimum of 4 draws (2 months) for the score to reach your range. This calculation does not consider more people entering/leaving the Express Entry pool.

If you have 3 months left on your PGWP, you may still have a chance at receiving an ITA. However, there is no guarantee.

As such, you need to take proactive steps now to ensure you can remain in Canada. I don't know what province you are in but check all the PNP programs you may be eligible for and even PR LMIA options and ask your employer for support. If they do not provide, look for employment elsewhere.

I know you worked hard for this job but if you'll lose status in Canada because they don't provide support, maybe you need to make the difficult decision to find an employer who values you more.

Hope this helps a little! Wishing you all the best."

To be valid, a job offer must be under a positive LMAI, which basically means that the company have exhaustively searched for a Canadian or PR candidate but no one could fill the requirements.

I applied to thousands of positions on LinkedIn, most of them ignored me completely, a few of them interviewed me but later ignored me until I found one that extended me an offer.

I know now you can have a PGWP extension and what not, but there are still so many people in the pool with lower scores. 
I’m myself sitting in the pool with only 437 (21y.o, software developer with a 2 year Canadian diploma and 1,5 year of work experience, maxed out English exam scores). 

I just can’t believe that the government would let young graduates who already have their whole life here and who pay taxes just leave the country.

But when people sign up for student visas, you were explicity told it is a ""temporarily visa"". This is NOT a Permanent Residence visa. Therefore the argument that you ""built your whole life"" here in Canada on a student visa is not a valid ethical reason for why Canada should automatically extend your visa. You choose to be here on a student visa. While it maybe unfair, Canada owes no obligations to any temporary visa holders to extend current visa or issue new visas. Also, Work Permit visa is NOT Permanent Resident visa either and Canada would never gureentree path to citizenship. Even PR is not a guarantee path but just a path to citizenship. Unfortunately, it is what it is and you just need to navigate it. 

Having said that, no I don't know many people who were told to leave the country after completing a degree or diploma on student visas. Most of the time they will extend it or issue a Work Permit."
i6izyc,Express Entry,"My wife and I want to move from the UK to Canada, but first we want to hear some experiences of those who’ve done the same!","Hi guys,

For a long time now, I (32m) have been thinking of emigrating at some point. My wife and I are expecting our first child in a couple of months, and I know deep down that i want my child to see some of what the world has to offer. We live in the Midlands in the UK, and natural beauty is in short supply. I've always felt sort of trapped here, and I long for huge open natural spaces, beautiful scenery and fresh air.

I finally blurted out to my wife (28f) about my strong desire to raise our family elsewhere, and i was amazed at how receptive she was to the idea. We quickly homed in on Canada as a potential destination, and i've set a loose financial plan that would hopefully allow us to move there within the next 3 or 4 years, before our first child starts school. We're also looking at flying over in 6 months or so to see some of Canada before we commit to anything.

I've been researching every possible variable for our big move (climate, job market etc), but really I think we BOTH need to hear the experiences of anyone who has moved from the UK to Canada. I mean, i want to know everything. We've been looking more at Alberta and British Columbia, but nowhere is off the table (except perhaps the northern territories, I don't think the wife desires -60c winters)

If you could tell me the following at the least, i would be super grateful, but anything you think is relevant would be awesome too :)

\- Where in Canada did you move to?  
\- What method did you use to immigrate? (Express entry, etc)
\- Why did you choose your specific destination, and were you right to do so?  
\- General summary of the climate wherever you moved to  
\- Did you have a job waiting for you, or did you have to find something once there?  
\- Would you recommend it?  
\- How did your family and friends react to your news, and how far in advance did you let them know?

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/i6izyc/my_wife_and_i_want_to_move_from_the_uk_to_canada/,"I didn’t immigrate from the UK, but I come from Western Europe and immigration-wise the process And opportunities are very similar.

- I moved to Ontario, lived in Niagara Falls for a couple years and recently moved to Toronto. I moved to the falls area because there’s one of the cheapest colleges in the province and the cost of living is lower.

- I came as an international student, I wanted to secure my PR as soon as possible without “wasting” time in my home country (foreign education and work experience barely count compared to Canadian). Now I’m waiting for my PGWP and, if everything goes well I will have minimum 490 points by next spring.

- We reached -20 up to -30 in early 2018. Overall in Southern Ontario and Toronto winters are very tolerable and I come from a fairly warm country with mild winters.

- No job, no family, nothing. I left my country at 18 to go to college and my parents thought I was crazy. Once in Canada, finding part time jobs and a full time job after graduating wasn’t very difficult.

- I recommend it, I think it’s worth all the hassle and that Canada has a lot of long-term potential. I think that in a near future people will begin mass-immigrating to Canada and it’ll be more difficult than it is now.

- As I’ve said, they thought I was crazy at first, but they supported my decision and agreed to support me during my studies. 

Other family members thought I was too young to know what I wanted. They still think I am, but now I’m making x2 their salary as a recent graduate so they stopped talking about it.

ql7x6x,Express Entry,"I got filed for a misrepresentation on my PR, facing 5 year bar from Canada.","The IRCC deemed that I misrepresented my work status (which I didn’t) but now I have two choices and i want advice/ pros and cons for each. If you guys could help me, I would really appreciate it. I have to have a decision this week.

1. Appeal - if I appeal this misrepresentation it halts my removal from Canada (my fiancée is currently here, she is not a Canadian PR or citizen) the forces a hearing for a judge to look at this case and deem whether or not I did actually misrepresent myself. If they deem I didn’t the bar from Canada is never executed. A lawyer quoted me $11,000 and a year long process for this. Thats a lot of money and time, I wouldn’t be able to leave the country at all during this time or the bar would be upheld.

2. Go back home and wait for my fiancée’s immigration to pass for that - obviously this is free, but would prevent me from entering Canada for 5 years. With the extra $11,000 I was planning on buying a house, which I would be able to do sooner. But does that Canadian Bar affect my ability to travel or live in other countries as well? How long does that last? 

Thank in advance for any answers or support. Cheers.

EDIT: I’ve had few people ask how I got charged with misrepresentation. Here is the scenario:

The IRCC deemed that i didn’t own and operate my own business (which I did) and  my filing should have been as “self employed” instead of “business owner”

I owned a business that had 60 employees over  offices in 3 cities at one point (Victoria, Vancouver, and Ottawa) that had a contract doing retail sales for big box stores (Canadian tire, Marks, Sportchek, and Walmart). When COVID-19 happened, all work stopped in the middle of my PR application. Because my business ceased, they deemed i was not an “employer” and instead “only self employed”

My original immigration consultant passed away 2 weeks after filing my PR and when I switch to a New lawyer he caught discrepancies that the consultant had submitted. 

The whole process has been a nightmare and A waste of three years (possibly more based iff how long the appeal is). I’ve essentially paid $20k to get blacklisted from commonwealth countries for the rest of my life and now I have to pay another $10k to get out of it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/ql7x6x/i_got_filed_for_a_misrepresentation_on_my_pr/,"do you live together with your fiance? if you two live together for one year and enter into a common-law, she would likely be inadmissible to Canada based on the fact that youve got a removal order.

Telephone number: +1 (888) 240-2100\*,\* from within Canada only, Monday to Friday, 8am to 4pm local time, except for statutory holidays).

**A quick summary:**

**Dial:** \+1 (888) 240-2100

*Welcoming messag*e:  ""Welcome to Immigration Canada..."" (***can't be skipped***)

==> **press 1** for English (I called from Quebec)

==> **(wait for about 2.5 minutes)** long announcements taking about (***this part can't be skipped, pressing any key indeed adds more time)***  (*See Note A.)*

==> **press 1** for UCI entry (wait until the prompt finished)

\----> **wait until you hear a new prompt**, then **dial your UCI ""XXXXXXXXXX""** (don't rush, otherwise you will miss the first digit dialed) ----> **press 1** to confirm the entry. (*See Note B.)*

==> **press 1** (for already applied). (*See Note C)*

It's not their job to give advice (this is what licenced immigration consultants and lawyers are for), tell you how long your application will take to process (they won't know this anyway), or explain how you can be eligible for an immigration program.

noxdpi,Express Entry,Changes in EE - FSW going forward,"So just read an article on the changes expected to come in the EE system, which was discussed at the recent budget meeting. What I understand :

1. Canada immigration policies for foreign workers will be more aligned to the required skill set of Canada and each province. Not every NOC will be invited, similar to how Australia and NZ operate. Major emphasis will be on the experience and NOC experience, rather than the age and language proficiency. 

This could be huge, since what I gather is that a lot of immigrants coming into the country don’t possess the necessary experience, despite scoring high on education, age and language scores. 

2. Gender : majority in the pool are male. So they might look into focusing more on balancing this between make and female primary applicants. 

Not sure this will effect people are currently in the pool or those who have an LMIA and the necessary high points to be invited, but I’m curious to know.

So far for the month of December 2022, we have not had any EE draws. I am wondering what are you guys planning to do? Specifically those sitting at the 470-489 score. 

My PGWP expired in last December, so far I've been told that I will get an updated work permit delivered sometime in October but I waited till December. Nothing came to the mail. Some of my friends received theirs. I know I'm not the only person facing this problem as I created another post on this issue and got many similar responses from people. To those wondering, I applied for an extension separately under the new policy. I would provide the link to it here however, the last day to apply was Dec 31.

Anyway, what are your thoughts? I know how all of you feel. Any backup plans???  I've been in the EE pool since March of last year. They're introducing Billc16 in March-April.

sbvxvp,Express Entry,"eCOPR confirmed. These are the mistakes I made, what I wish I knew in hindsight, as a European skilled immigrant.","I hope this is useful. Basically a little more reading before I ever came to the country and I could have had residency about a year earlier...

TLDR: 

1. Get your police clearances early. I was asked for police clearance from a country I'd only spent 2 months in.
2. Don't take anything for granted. I did 9 months of self employed seasonal work before realising it didn't count towards Canadian Experience Class.
3. Don't stress too much, the system is fucking dogshit but: I was given a deadline of April to get my employer compliance fee, but never saw the email until July. I got the fee paid in August and received the work permit extension in October. I'm sure that they could have kicked me out of the country if they'd been having a bad day.
4. The terms of the PNP are enough hours per month but they don't actually immediately revoke your support if you don't get enough hours for some reason - but they'll never tell you this!

Timeline:

Enter Canada on working holiday February 2019. 
Do a 3 month local trade course (I probably should have checked if that counted for anything points wise)
Do 4.5 months full time employment May - September 
Go into self employed seasonal work in September 2019, do that until May 2020.
Use E.I. for 2 months.
Talk to a lawyer who has no clue how to help me.
Start more full time work end of July 2020.
Talk to a lawyer who has no clue how to help me September 2020.
Apply PNP October 2020, having realised that I won't have enough time for CEC by February 2021. (I would be on 11 months. Number of hours per month is irrelevant, they want to see hours per week because the bureaucracy is stupid).
Get PNP November 2021. (I'm on 1050 points)
Get ITA and apply 16 December 2021.

See a requirement for police clearance from country A. Apply for it thinking it will be no issue. Get given a deadline of February to get that police clearance.

Get rejected January 12, 2021 (I have 23 days until working holiday expires so cue panic). 

I got rejected because I had what I thought was my country B police clearance my mislabeled, it was actually a different copy of my other country C police clearance. So I got rejected as incomplete. 

I would also have been rejected as incomplete for multiple missing signatures, addresses, and phone numbers from my ridiculously long list of employers, having been self employed and needing proofs from anyone that paid me.

It turns out I would eventually have been rejected as incomplete for country A police clearance, as that didn't arrive until May.

I thought the work permit support letter let me be here so I focused on getting reinvited.
Apply for work permit extension 6 days after work permit expired (THIS DOES NOT WORK) - luckily I had already applied for a work permit extension when I got my ITA (and forgot in the panic) and so had implied status from that.
Got an email at the end of January about the valid work permit extension application asking for employer compliance fee and telling me that I had until April 8 to get that done or the application would be invalid and I therefore wouldn't have implied status.

I think I got the next ITA before my work permit expired, but confusion was reigning - it was the work permit extension that actually mattered and luckily I had one already...

This second attempt at express entry PNP supported PR application decided I needed a police clearance from country D.  I didn't get this until July 16, I was given a deadline of July 18 on May 18 to get this completed.

Throughout this whole time I'm constantly emailing the PNP support trying to find out what they actually require from a supporting employer. I was hung up on the idea that they might withdraw support if my employer didn't provide enough hours. Apparently this doesn't really matter, as long as there is a contract saying that the employer intends to give you full time hours and usually does it's no drama. I had 6 months of about 100 hours of employment... They never gave a straight answer, only ever the cookie cutter response. I would ask ""what happens if I don't get enough hours"" they would say ""you need to get enough hours"". Really crappy support, but a thousand times better than the federal...

In July I contacted the PNP support about my work permit extension status, and they called me because they saw my second pointless application and freaked me out. Luckily I had the other one! It took over a month to get the employer compliance fee paid because the IRCC website is terrible and broken.

So, end of July I get the application completed and submitted.

End of August I get my work permit extension application completed and submitted (6 months late).

In October I got the work permit extension (valid until January 2022, but now I'm a pro so I got the next application set up)

About a week or 2 ago I got the email about confirmation of permanent residency.

I got the eCOPR today 🙂

I'll get the PR card sometime between now and May?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/sbvxvp/ecopr_confirmed_these_are_the_mistakes_i_made/,"Why were you asked to get a police certificate for 2 months stay?

Things that happened back home really effected me, I'm still in shock. It's hard to convey it but it's easy to be lost and numb in it. I don't know. 

But with that said, lot of money has been spent on my journey in here. Out of 3 years, I have already trashed 10 months of my PGWP. 

Is it too late now? Or I still have enough time? Is it still worth it to try? Or is it damaged and done?

I know I am fool. Please, give me advice on how to use this remaining time wisely. I don't have any friends so I am opening up here. Thanks.

x0x3bq,Express Entry,"Beginning to look into immigrating, are we being ripped-off/scammed?","Edit: thank you all for your support and help, we're definitely more at ease now and won't be talking to this agency anymore. We didn't give any sensitive or financial data to them. The only good thing is that this little panic made us look further into this and found so much info available, uncluding this sub :), thank you all!

Hello all, I’ll give more details bellow but long story short: my GF started talking to an immigration consultant and right after she submitted basic info they are requesting payment (starting with \~650 CAD, but totaling \~2500 CAD by the end) to begin the “paperwork process”. Also, they said that if we choose not to follow through with the process with them, since they already “started her evaluation” and “she submitted her application” she wouldn’t be able to apply for one year. They pressed for credit card info through the phone but we weren’t comfortable enough with this, after stalling a little we bought us some time by saying we needed to check our bank to approve our cards for international payments.  
 

Are we being scammed, or is this common practice? If so, does this “one year cooldown” really apply to her, even if we didn’t submit anything formal to the Canadian Government?  
 

More details: We live in Brazil, been together for a little more than 3 years but not officially married (on papers, I mean). She always wanted to move to Canada and after concluding her graduation, and now being between jobs was a good motivator to finally look into immigrating to Canada. We both have engineering degrees, and 28y, so we are presuming we should follow through the Express Entry, although I don’t plan to leave my current job in the next years, it’s fully remote and would allow me to travel.

Even though she’s applying to jobs mostly through LinkedIn, I pointed out that maybe she could get in touch with an immigration office, or talent agency that could help her find a job in Canada and help navigating through the red tape. She said that would look into it, and today she got a call in the morning from this agency called “Canada Immigration Express”, where she signed up for an initial interview (and paid 10 USD for that).

Throughout the call the consultant explained a little about the process, the types of visa, and prices. After all doubts were answered, he jumped right into the payment part, and proceeded to cite this disclaimer that “we should choose whether to follow on with the process or not, but should we choose the latter, since she already submitted her information, she wouldn’t be able to apply again for one year”. Also, they insisted that they needed the payment and card as proof of identity and interest for the legal team to begin working on the paperwork.

Anyways, the way the site is set up, the pressure to pay, and the little contradictions in the story (if they need payment to begin the process, why do we need to pay now because the process has already started?) lit up all red alerts in my head and got us both very defensive. The only info she gave them was name, gender, age, diploma and CV.

How was your experience with immigration consultants? Is this normal? Any recommendations?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/x0x3bq/beginning_to_look_into_immigrating_are_we_being/,"Oh my god this is the biggest lie.

n5d51g,Express Entry,"Stranded, Insanely Stressed and Just out of luck :( I will be grateful of any help!! Please!","Let me first state my current situation before telling my story.

* I am presently not in Canada and my PGWP is expiring in 4 months.
* I have a low CRS score of only 409.
* I completed my high school and 2 year diploma in Canada and lived there for 8 entire years.
* I have 1 year of foreign work experience and the highest possible score band for IELTS.

My story is that I took a loan and moved to Canada but lost my Singaporean citizenship due to not joining the military at 18. My parents were moving out of Singapore and they advised me against it and as a dumb kid I heeded. In Canada, I completed high school while staying with a guardian (parents moved to India) and then went onto a community college and completed a 2 year diploma but I took my time because I managed to get a part time job in marketing through heavy networking. That turned out useless as I later found out skilled work experience under a study permit does not count towards PR. I also lost 2 years in between due to a car accident where I was hospitalized for a while.

So I finally graduate in December 2019, apply for my PGWP, only to find out COVID is now a thing and  I cant even apply for jobs. The company I worked part time for organized business events in Vancouver and therefore had to close shop, leaving me unemployed. Unable to afford a sustainable lifestyle in Canada, I was forced to move to India. In this time, my parents moved back to Singapore and now here I am in India all alone. I have no family or friends here because I never lived here. I somehow managed to get a job in marketing and now attained a year of foreign work experience. But despite this, I still have a **hefty loan to pay back IN DOLLARS**. Its basically slave labour here in India, I get paid peanuts and i'll be nowhere close to paying back my loan in 30 years especially with the Indian rupee dropping every year.

So my question is, **what are some way to immigrate back to Canada**?

1. Is PNP **difficult** to obtain with a CRS score of 409?
2. Do I need a **job offer** if I apply for BC PNP. I read that I need it but some people on reddit say I dont if I did both high school and post graduate diploma from there.
3. Will it help to **study in an Atlantic province** for a year and apply for PNP through there since it is easier and takes less time?
4. Should I go for the **TEF/TCF route**? I see that even a median score band, my points go up above 470! How **hard is it to learn french** and **how long would it take** a year or two maybe? I picked up spanish fairly quickly and was fluent in a year's time, could that be the case with french?
5. Any other way to improve my CRS score? Even if I max out on foreign work experience, I'll still only be at 434. I see that a canadian degree does not help either, a masters is more helpful. But if I complete my degree and then masters, I lose out on 3 years experience and if I do all three, i'll be over 30 years of age.
6. I know I cant extend my PGWP since I wasnt in Canada when the public policy was announced. Any other way to get it extended?

I know PR is **IMPOSSIBLE** at 409. My Indian citizenship does not allow for work holiday visa. I honestly dont see the point in studying again because I cannot get another PGWP. **Please give me some options to think about**. I have nobody here in India. It's an alien country for me, even though I am Indian by race, I never lived here before.

sq7ivg,Express Entry,How do you approach your MP as an immigrant?,"Hi everyone, first time poster, long-time lurker here! 

Sorry if this this a dumb question, I'm not familiar with the concept of approaching local government as an immigrant because I was always told I was ""using resources"" that were not meant for me. 🤷

Anyway, I am currently on a work permit in Canada and have a PR application (FSW Inland) that has been ""processing"" for 19 months. Any time I message IRCC I just get the boilerplate message of ""we're working on your application, please be patient because of Covid delays."" Meanwhile I am hearing about people who applied after me (some of them FSW too) getting their PRs, and it's very frustrating to have to just wait around not even accruing time for citizenship. 

Some of my Canadian friends have suggested contacting my MP and asking them for help, and I've seen on this subreddit of people reaching out to their MPs for immigration help and it working. So my questions are... 

- How do I reach out? Do I just bug them with calls or is an email enough?
- What do I say?

ycubdm,Express Entry,How does the needing to be in Canada for 730 days for the past 5 years to keep PR thing work for your first 5 years after getting PR?,"So my family want to apply for PR but I may head to the UK for a 3 year college course, though I'm waiting until I get PR to do so.    

For the first 5 years, how does the 730 day requirement work? Do you have to make sure you've been there for a full 730 days in the past 5 years only once you've reached the 5-year mark? (which should be fine, as I will come back to Canada between terms, plus the year before and after the course should add up to the full 730 days)  

Thanks in advance for the answers. I know some of you may recommend to just get PR independently of my parents when I'm done with university but I don't think that's viable as even with a degree I don't think I'd come even close to having enough points, with how ridiculously high they are right now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/ycubdm/how_does_the_needing_to_be_in_canada_for_730_days/,"During the first 5 years, the question they evaluate is ""does it remain mathematically possible for you to be physically present in Canada [including time outside Canada that an exception treats as inside Canada] for 730 days during those first five years?"" Once you actually achieve those 730 days, of course the answer is yes. 

Until then, every time they look at it, they add up the number of days you have in Canada so far as a PR, add the remaining days in your first five year period, and see if the answer is at least 730. I'm not sure to what degree they can discount future time when they don't actually believe you're going to come back, but my 70% understanding is that it's just a mathematical calculation instead of trying to read your mind.

So, if you're confident you're going to achieve the 730 days and you have the plan you describe of returning home during breaks and with a very clearly temporary reason for the absences during the academic semesters, then don't worry, you'll be fine. But you may have a bunch of questions from border officers, and IRCC will take a close look at what actually ended up happening during your first PR card renewal or PRTD application.

Also, be aware that you may be delaying your eligibility for citizenship with this plan, since the physical presence calculation for qualifying to become a citizen is quite different. But that's not a problem if you are okay with that."

i192ie,Express Entry,I just woke up. How bad is it? What are my options.,"I am an Indian. Due to personal reasons (I'll share that in the comments if anyone is interested, but trying to keep the post relevant) staying in the country is not an option and I am looking to migrate. 

I am an undergrad Civil Engineering student, about to graduate. By the end of my first year, I realized I was in a really shitty situation and decided to make the best of it and look up opportunities of migrating.

Aus, NZ and Canada really appealed to me cuz they followed a merit based grading system. I saw a few positive stories on Quora (basic shit ""you get work experience and IELTS score and you will get in just like me"") and decided that's what I was gonna go for them(Yes I was naive as hell, IK!). I wish I knew of Reddit back then.

So I postponed further research on this subject and worked my ass off to get above average internships whenever and wherever I could so I'd get a decent job for my 1-2 years of job experience. 

Fast forward to today, I am waiting for my final exams before I graduate. I have a job offer from a prestigious company in my field (also my dream company) although the pay is a bit low. 

Having so much of free time, I decided to get back to my research and stumbled on this subreddit. been scanning through for the last 12 hours or so. Lo and behold, I am Fucked! 

**So here is my condition 2 years from now:**

* Single, 24 years old
* Not a Canadian degree or diploma holder
* Will be a Bachelor in Civil Engineering from an Indian Uni (not sure if that counts)
* Let's assume conservative estimates and I barely pass IELTS with 6.5 in all 4. No french
* No work experience in Canada.
* 2 years of full time work experience in India.
* No certificate of Qualification, no Job offer and no Valid job offer.
* No blood relatives in Canada.

**I get a score of 342** (assuming my degree is equivalent to Canadian 3-4 years degree. If someone can clarify, that would be helpful).

So what do I do? **Do I go for a 1-2 year diploma course in Canada?** A**ssuming after that, I get 1-2 years to find a Job in Canada. Will the employer need LMIA to hire me after I complete my diploma from a Canadian educational institute?**

I don't think I can get into a master's program in a Uni (details in comments). 

I don't expect my situation is any better in the Australian or NZ context (but at least there I fall under the Absolute skill shortage category) but anyone have any insight on that or could direct me to subreddit dedicated to that, I'd appreciate it.

I haven’t gotten my invite for CEC and FSW yet and am still waiting. My open work permit is expiring on December 7, 2022.

If I still haven’t gotten my invite by then, I will have to leave the country is that correct? An immigrations officer did say I can still apply for pr even outside of Canada, so it’s not the end of the world for me in this case. I’ve looked into PNP, but my current job does not qualify for it because it has an end date and is a contract position. I could apply for a new job (my contract ends the same day my work permit ends), but would employers even suggest employing me for a permanent position given my expiring work permit? I tried talking to the boss for my current job but the only job there that I’m qualified for is actually a temp to perm position. I also don’t seem to qualify for the pgwp since I applied for that last year and I now have an open work permit. 

Realistically speaking, what would be my options? As I’m a dual citizen of two other countries, it’s not the end of the world if I don’t get it, but I am very disappointed, especially in myself, considering I picked up work and did the ielts to obtain pr. And hearing everyone hype up Canada as the best country in the world to immigrate and that the living standards are better than all other countries, just makes it really desirable.

My husband and I quit our jobs in UAE with the expectation of moving to Vancouver, BC in April. Things couldn’t have gone more wrong. But we are in such a helpless situation right now. The job market is really bad here so finding a new job here is not possible. It was always bad which is why we are moving. Now its worse. So the only option we have is to move to BC in July when the flights hopefully start opening up again. I know the situation in Canada isn’t that great either at the moment. But, what do you guys think I should do? I have funds to keep us ok for 6 months in Canada without any job. Survival job is all we are looking for now. Something to survive this pandemic. What is the chance of finding something there as a new immigrant?

Just to let you know, Emirates has resumed flights from Dubai to Toronto from 21st of May. This also means that your COPR won't be extended in August so you would have no choice but to travel to Canada. I am most likely going to fly mid June as my COPR expires in August as well. Since return flights to UAE appear to be opening, in a worst case scenario, I will return after 3 or so months of unsuccessful job searches.


I think the job market will bounce back, not so easily though. It really depends on your sector, mine is not that affected. You might have to go the extra mile though, i have realised it is definitely becoming hard. 

Since I am going to Ontario, I have been in touch with with a few organisations that cater to newcomers. They are funded by the IRCC and they help you in terms of finding a place, get your network growing for jobs etc. Here is the link for the pre-arrival services for Ontario that I have been using https://settlement.org/ontario/immigration-citizenship/immigrating-to-ontario/general-information-about-applying/what-are-pre-arrival-services/

I would suggest you find one for BC, if that is where you will be staying. In mean time, here are some generic main ones that apply to all of Canada https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/new-life-canada/pre-arrival-services/prepare-live.html

I would highly recommend that you look at these services! 

I also plan on avoiding large cities and hiding out in the outskirts. They are much cheaper than Toronto or Vancouver itself. Can easily stretch out your savings.

Finally, do not forget to get your RTA certificate in order to skip the driving test etc for a Canadian drivers license. You might have to also get it attested from MOFA as it appears to be a hit and a miss at times if its not attested."

I created a throwaway account for my first post in reddit, I need your advice. I will try to keep this as short as possible, but I can provide more details as necessary.

Here is the summary of my situation;

I live and work in BC and going for CEC. The company I currently work for is a family-owned, small size, local manufacturer. I was hired and have been working as a Sales Manager for the last \~1,5 years.

A few months ago, I sent an e-mail to my boss for a standard reference letter for immigration purposes. I shared with them the Reference Letter I had from my previous job (which was also in BC), to make it easier for them.

To make a long story short, I was ignored for weeks, then when I took this up with my boss personally, she made it clear that she did not want to give me this letter. We had a verbal argument, followed by the her giving me a ""letter"". This letter doesn't mention my position properly (says ""Manager"", instead of ""Sales Manager"", doesn't mention any start date, pay information, responsibilities etc. Simply put, this letter by itself is not sufficient for me to submit with my application.

Afterwards, when I inquired with long-time employees, they told me that this is common in the company, with people crying on the spot or simply leaving the company in the past because of this.

Obviously I decided to leave the company after all this, but during our argument, she also mentioned something in the lines of ""Don't think it's over with the letter, they (CIC) will call me when reviewing your application""

I am mentally exhausted and shocked, I need your advice on what to do.

Moreover, for the 1% of us who were not aware of this list, this could be helpful. I saw one boat-mate asking in the other post whether a web developer would qualify for these category-based draws. As we can see, the very last NOC code pertains to a web developer, so yes, you would qualify (as per the NOC code list released by IRCC) unless they change the NOC codes at the very last moment due to some reason.

As for the conundrum you point out, all that can be said is there is more than one way to get a work permit. If you find it's not possible to get an LMIA-supported work permit (and it will be difficult if you don't already have authorization to work), then you have to find another way.

A couple of other points: general labour in landscaping or low/semi-skilled work in Tim Horton's will not give you points for work experience nor for having a valid job offer in EE. The work must be considered ""skilled"". Also, I have never heard of a ""management consultant loophole"" (you'll find there are very few ""loopholes"" in Canadian immigration); I would tread with caution."

Photo change + Address change request you are not aware of = treat it as identity theft. I would call my bank and alert them. Next time you hear something like this (someone called to request change of address), immediately call your bank and Service Canada.

I would not set this as a realistic target for EE FSW.

> If I start all the paperwork right now, would it be possible to move there by the end of the year?

Creating an EE profile is pretty simple, but you'll need [langauge tests](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/language-requirements.html) and to have your educational achivements [ECA'd](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/education-assessed.html). The problem is more, when will EE FSW draws resume? Nobody knows the answer to that question. The last draw for FSW I believe was December 2020. 

>Is EE the best option in my situation?

It depends what your CRS is and how quickly you want to move. 
Have a look at the [CRS calculator](https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/crs-tool.asp) and calculate what your CRS would be if you were to create a profile. You can then have a look at the [previous draws](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/ministerial-instructions/express-entry-rounds.html) to gain an understanding of the type of scores you need. EE FSW is around 468+ the last time draws were going on.

The quickest way for you to get to Canada would be the [IEC](https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/work/iec/eligibility.asp?country=es&cat=wh&#country_category_name_cont). The IEC season is currently closed - people are hoping it opens again early this year. That is obviously a unknown to all. 

>Should I contact companies to get a job offer before applying for EE?

That's what everyone *wants* to achieve, but few do. The reason being that you have to be a pretty strong candidate to be willing to go to the effort of both sponsoring and waiting for. The fact you're a dev helps though, as that is probably the most desired profession going.

> Are there any important deadlines in the year that I should know about?

148gezx,Express Entry,Data Analytics on CRS score data,"I've noticed a lot of posts about the possibility of the CRS score being reduced.

Note: this is only for draws labeled either ""No program Specified"" or ""Foreign Skilled Worker"". I decided to skip the others cause the data from those draws skews it too much. 

Since attaching the image and video is disabled, the link below takes you to the dynamic version of the visual:[https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNDJjMTM1MTEtNmU1YS00Njg2LWExZjQtYjEzZmQwOWUyYzcwIiwidCI6ImE3ZjRjYzEwLTJmNjYtNDc5OC05MmE4LWM4NmI3YmRhYzM2YSJ9](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNDJjMTM1MTEtNmU1YS00Njg2LWExZjQtYjEzZmQwOWUyYzcwIiwidCI6ImE3ZjRjYzEwLTJmNjYtNDc5OC05MmE4LWM4NmI3YmRhYzM2YSJ9)

Some observations:

1. The historical Average Score has been 465 and the 80% percentile score has been 483.  However, off lately (post-2022), the scores have been high and the average score has been 502 (not included in the graph).
2. Scores and # of invitations have been mostly complementing each other since the start of the program. An increase in invitations leads to a decrease in a score, *assuming a constant rate of draws.*
3. Historically, the invitations have been kept in the ballpark of 3500-4000 per draw.
4. While it's really difficult to predict the scores, a jump in the score is accompanied by a period of consolidation, i.e., the scores normally remain in a range before jumping up again. A good score in the period of 2017-2020 would have been 460-465 but since the pandemic, a good score has jumped considerably to late 480s/early 490s.
5. The TBATS time-series forecasting model predicts (attached: [https://imgur.com/a/xkvGnv6](https://imgur.com/a/xkvGnv6)) the score to drop to 478 in the next draw and further to 472 in the next 4 draws before going up again, considering a draw of 5000 each with draws each within 14 days. Take this with a grain of salt. Also, it doesn't account for new entrants to the pool.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/148gezx/data_analytics_on_crs_score_data/,"Great analysis! But I would guess that the actual future cut-off scores would be higher than the TBATS model's prediction because there isn't enough history to account for the more recent rise in cut-off scores (resulting from the pandemic backlogs and other factors) compared to the pre-pandemic extended periods of lower scores. So with trigonometric seasonality, it predicts that scores should dip significantly in the future (which may not be the case in reality)."

If you don't want to settle there, you could stay for a year or two as you have moral and ethical responsibility to stay in the province that issues the PNP.

&#x200B;

You have 45 days to submit your application for OINP. If you think the CRS would reduce in the coming draws, which I think it would, you could wait.

&#x200B;

I would suggest waiting for one or two express entry draws and seeing if the score is coming down. This might save you CAD 1,500. In the meantime, you could start gathering the documents right away for OINP and later if you get an ITA for express entry, you could use the same documents as the requirements are mostly the same. If you don't get an ITA, you could apply for OINP before the 45 days are over.

16vfca7,Express Entry,Guide to Valid Job Offers in Express Entry (hint: without an LMIA it's probably not valid),"There is a lot of confusion about job offers for Express Entry, mainly because of IRCC's explanation of it which spans several webpages.

Although you may have a job offer from your employer, and the offer may be permanent, that alone does not make it ""valid"" for points in Express Entry. This seems to be the most common scenario posters give here, and they are frustrated and confused why their job offer on their PGWP didn't give them 50 points (or 200 if very lucky).

There are [three](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/offer-employment.html) ways that a job offer can be ""valid"" (and thus give you points) in Express Entry:

1. Have a new approved LMIA

2. Be already working for an employer on a work permit based on a previously approved LMIA (among other requirements)

3. The other way

One and two above are based on approved LMIAs. That's fairly straightforward and most users on this sub are likely already at least somewhat familiar with LMIAs. For those who aren't, an LMIA is an application made by a Canadian employer to ESDC (note: not IRCC) to hire a foreign worker because a local (Canadian citizen or permanent resident) worker is unavailable. It entails the employer showing how they could not find a local worker and that without a (foreign) worker to fill a position at their company, their business will suffer. The ease with which this can be approved depends entirely on the employer's situation, and the foreign worker themselves have almost nothing at all to do with the process. They just receive the approval letter at the end which they can use for 1. or 2. above.

As for 3. This is complicated, and it's not an option available to everyone. A job offer can be valid without an LMIA if:

- You have a valid work permit that is exempt from an LMIA, and

- You are currently working for an employer **specified on the work permit**, and

- have one year of full-time work experience (or an equal amount of part-time work) for that employer, and 

- You have a valid job offer from that employer for at least one year after we issue your permanent resident visa

The second point above is what eliminates most people. The employer **must be named on your work permit**. In other words, an open work permit does NOT, in any way at all, allow you to claim points for having a valid job offer in Express Entry. This is why as soon as someone says that they have a PGWP, SOWP, working holiday, etc., you can immediately know that they will not get those points. 

So how do you get an employer-specific work permit that is not based on an LMIA? There are actually a wide variety of ways, whether it be through an international agreement between Canada and a foreign country (e.g. CUSMA, IEC), or the type of occupation (e.g. religious worker). But as mentioned, this isn't for everyone. If your country is one that doesn't have an agreement with Canada, and your job doesn't fit to those who can get a work permit without an LMIA, then your employer must obtain the LMIA for you to get those points.

With all that said, job offers for *most* enhanced PNP pathways do NOT require an LMIA. So, it can be possible to have a job offer as the basis to be eligible for a PNP stream, apply through that stream, and get 600 points for a nomination in Express Entry and avoid needing an LMIA. You would still need to be eligible and invited in whichever PNP stream you choose, but it can make the work easier for the employer if an LMIA isn't needed. I hope that helps.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/16vfca7/guide_to_valid_job_offers_in_express_entry_hint/,"This is a very great guide. When I was in the pool in 2021, I was a member of a few Telegram channels and this was one of the most common mistakes. Folks added a offer on PGWP to the CRS points calculator and thought they would get an extra 50 points.

This is a good link to add to your post, it has details on all the exemptions for LMIA-exempt job offers: https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/offer-employment/lmia-exempt.html

I got the points because I had a closed CUSMA work permit (it was called NAFTA when it was issued) so I went in and looked at the specific requirements. That would be number 1: `covered by an international agreement`.

Postdocs were the only other category of folks that I saw with a realistic chance at the job offer points. They're covered under (3)(c)(ii):

    3. exempt for “Canadian interests” reasons  
    c. designated by the Minister
    ii. competitiveness and public policy

n2ch7t,Express Entry,"Please HELP, Travel history for EX flight attendant - HR won't provide me flight record","Hi,

I used to be an international flight attendant from 2013 to 2014. 

I know I have to list my travel history in the past 10 years, but during 2013-2014 there is no way I can check which countries I've been to.

I tried to get a hold of the company HR, but they're being very slow to respond and not willing to help.

I think at the very least what I can say in the LOE is the following

\- Include departure/arrival record from my home country => my country DO have departure/arrival record with date, but it DOESN'T say which countries I've been to! :( But, I think including this will show that each of my trips between 2013-2014 was very short (2-3 days), hence it could prove that I won't likely need PCC for those countries.

\- All of my past and current passports => I don't have too many stamps, since most countries do not stamp for cabin crews. but I will make sure to list countries that I have stamps for.

\- I will mention the name of the countries I have been to, based on my memory. Although, I do not remember dates since there's no stamp on my passport.

My work permit will expire on March 2024. I have already maxed IELTS (8.00) and also have a Canadian Master's (2 years duration), so there really isn't any way I can find of improving my score. My problem is my lack of good work experience. I've been working 1.5 years in Canada, but it's in an unskilled job (NOC C / Teer 4, customer service position) so I am not gaining any score from that. I only have 1 year of skilled work experience from my home country, which is how my profile got eligibility but it is not giving me any good score (skilled work experience in Canada gives 40 while in foreign country it gives only 25). Moreover, even if I do get a skilled work now, I cannot complete 1 year as my permit will expire soon (unless they extend it).  
So what options do I have? I am thinking of applying for another funded Master's or even PHD (unlikely to get the latter). However, I cannot do it for January session, will have to do it for Sept next year, which means I will have to go back to my country once the work permit ends. I have doubt if they'd give student VISA again. Does anyone know if it's difficult to get another student visa for doing a second Master's in Canada?

I think i am currently in shock because my CRS points are closer to the 300 than to the 400, let along the high 400 required to apply.


I am currently in canada, awaiting my response for my student visa application and i have even paid half of my (international student fee) tuition towards my program. 

I am excited but at the same time i want to know what exactly this means.i know that invitation does not equal a PR, but this is a good thing right? 

I have had such a rough few years and this seems like a great opportunity for me and i do not want to mess it up, but i am very anxious of the steps.

I would like to know more about the process or even where do i go from here. I have 3months to submit an application and i want to be as thorough as possible.


Any insight is really appreciated!!


Thank you so much for everything!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/lkk59p/pr_invitation_under_cec/,"Here are the mistakes that I've made, hope you can learn from them.

I somehow submitted the wrong document for one of my police clearance checks. 

Lesson: double and triple check everything.

In the time whilst I wait to apply again I've gone through my documents and realised I did a very poor job.

I am missing signatures from multiple letters of reference, I did not provide T4s or CRA Notice of Assessments (I thought ROE and payslips would be enough but I've been informed otherwise).

Highly recommend you take your time to get everything ready and then go through it again a couple of days later with a fresh brain."
dtkevf,Express Entry,Warning: Do NOT take CELPIP. Take IELTS,"Native speaker here, and I am convinced CELPIP purposely gives scores of 8 on writing to scam you out of your test money + regrade money (my score did not change during a regrade).

Listening: 8.5  
Writing: 8.5

Our application has been at a stand still since March 30th and we found out today that they had the wrong middle name AND wrong country of residence. We put Georgia the state in the US and they had Georgia the country. 

The call center did not have any more information to give us. I am not sure what to do at this point. Keep waiting... But at some point I feel like I need to try to fix the errors. 

We already did a webform for the middle name, we found that out months ago, and thought it was fixed but clearly it wasn't. 

Sigh.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/1481vmh/at_a_loss_finally_got_a_hold_of_ircc_and_our/,">We put Georgia the state in the US and they had Georgia the country.

Are you certain the error wasn't on your side, and in the spaces to enter ""country"" in your application you didn't enter Georgia? This would be an important error to correct, because you must have valid immigration status in the country you apply from, and if IRCC believes you are in Georgia the country but you didn't include proof of your immigration status in that country, the application could be rejected as incomplete.

With that said, take anything the call centre agents say with a grain of salt. They are not the most reliable of sources for information. But I would definitely submit a webform email to IRCC about the country of residence, as that is material to your application."

jsbl8s,Study Permit,My Experience Traveling Now as an International Student,"So I recently got my study permit approved and traveled to Canada a few days ago, just thought I should warn people what to expect based on my experience.  So I brought a bunch of documents just to be safe, everything ranging from what they asked for on the official website such as proof of funds, proof of enrolment of a DLI to stuff they didn't ask for such as an email from my university approving my right to land in Canada as well as a bunch of bank statements to show I had the money in my bank account. However, the only documents I had to show were the correspondence letter you get from getting your study permit approved and my passport with an eTA or visa. The hard part is definitely getting onto the plane to Canada. The employees at your local airport might not know if you're allowed to travel because they don't know the details so you have to show/convince them that you are allowed, after that it's pretty much smooth sailing. They will check your forehead temperature and just ask to fill a paper with 3 small questions to prove that you don't have covid. Once you're in Canada you go to immigration, show your correspondence letter, they will send you to a room to get the physical study permit and send you off. They never asked for a quarantine plan or anything, just the letter and your passport. Good luck to any fellow students traveling!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/jsbl8s/my_experience_traveling_now_as_an_international/,Thanks for the details!

kltz9d,Study Permit,My experience travelling to Canada during the second wave of COVID-19,"I travelled to Canada as an international student on the 26th of December and I want to share my experience with you all since I’ve gotten a lot of help here with regards my trip and study permit. 

My flight was with Lufthansa via Frankfurt Germany. I couldn’t check in online because of COVID, all passengers have to check in at the airport to ensure that they are fit to travel. I spent the days  before my flight organising all my documents ( Passport , Correspondence letter ,Passport request, Letter of approval, Enrolment letter ,Tuition receipt ,Quarantine plan ,Admission letter) and i completed the check-in form on the ArriveCAN app, I didn’t print out the receipt but you can print it out if you want. 

When I arrived at my local airport, the only document they asked for was my enrolment letter and my study visa. I was given my boarding pass and I went through the normal security checks. The plane was half full so there were lots of empty seats. People in the middle rows had the four seats to themselves so they were able to lay down and sleep. 

Germany


On getting to Germany, the airport was also pretty empty and I was able to go through the security checks with no problem. At the boarding gate, a few names(my name included) were called via the intercom and we were asked to see one of the staff at the boarding gate. I was asked for my study visa, my boarding pass and ArriveCAN receipt(make sure you fill this out because I was asked for it numerous times during my travel). Once they checked everything, I went back to sit down and then eventually boarded the plane to Toronto. 

Toronto 

We were given an immigration card to fill on the plane to Toronto. When I arrived Toronto, I wasn’t sure where to go because I only had 1hr 45 minutes before my connecting flight to Halifax and I knew that I had to obtain my study permit at my first port of entry. Anyway I joined the wrong queue and was eventually directed downstairs to immigration. 
 
At the first immigration check, I was asked for the immigration card I filled earlier, my study visa and my quarantine plan as well as my ArriveCAN receipt. I was later ushered to the point where I would obtain my study permit and co-op work permit (I applied for both). 

At the second immigration check (where I was given my permits) I was asked for my acceptance letter, tuition receipt, study visa (passport) and they basically just asked me what I’ll be studying and that’s pretty much it.  They also told me that if I miss my flight because of immigration, they would put me on another flight but I obviously didn’t want that because the next flight required a 6-hour wait.

I was asked for my ArriveCAN receipt again in Nova Scotia and I was asked to fill out a Nova Scotia health check form. I am now in quarantine at a hotel booked by my school in Halifax. 

One thing I wish I did before coming was arranging how to get a SIM card and change currencies because I could not do that at the Halifax airport due to closures from Covid and I had limited time in Toronto so I couldn’t get it done there either. 

That said, does anyone know any good throwaway SIM cards I can order to my hotel? I can't order any of the main sim cards online (i.e bell, telus, rogers and their subsidiaries) because I need to show my ID and show proof of address (billing address must be the same with shipping address) which i cannot do.  I need to call up housing agents and landlords to sort out my accommodation for when I leave quarantine. So suggestions would be appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/kltz9d/my_experience_travelling_to_canada_during_the/,"Speak out 711 doesn't care for your residence, but you need a credit card for online or a 711 gas station nearby for cash"
14yfzxu,Study Permit,Study Permit Airport Process,"I landed yesterday at Toronto Perason as an international student and wanted to share the experience for other students.

From my plane landing to walking out of the airport the process took 50 minutes.

First I entered my declaration information at the machines.  

Then I walked down to the border officers. Here one of the officers at the queue noticed the code for my study permit on the declaration receipt and immediately sent me to the ""main"" immigration counter to get my permit.

At the immigration counter, there were four people ahead of me in line and I waited for no longer than 10 minutes. After presenting my passport and letter of introduction I was asked a few questions including:  
\- What are you studying  
\- Where are you studying  
\- How long is your course  
\- Why did you decide to study in Canada  
\- Why have you entered Canada in July when your course starts in September

After answering all of these questions my permit was printed and I walked to the luggage claim.  
After collecting my luggage, I walked to Service Canada near luggage collection belt 7 and obtained my SIN.

Hope that helps some international students arriving in Canada over the coming weeks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/14yfzxu/study_permit_airport_process/,Thanks for sharing. Did they ask for financial support documents?
s75uu4,Study Permit,"Study Permit Approval Rate by Citizenship, Age, Program of Study and Student Direct Stream",,https://i.redd.it/kzsgu7bj1ic81.png,"**Noticeable Trends:**

**(1) Country of Citizenship Matters A Lot:** Your country of citizenship will have an outsized impact on your chances of approval.

**(2) Older Applicants Have a Harder Time Getting Approved:** There is a clear correlation between older applicants and lower approval chances.

**(3) Higher Studies Usually Leads to Higher Approval Chances:** Choosing a higher level of studies will usually result in a higher chance of approval.

**(4) Take the Student Direct Stream Option (If Available):** Apart from the Philippines it's clear that SDS is worth the extra work as it will, on average, increase your chances of approval.

**Remember, These Are Just Averages!**

Always remember that individual facts affect individual outcomes. And remember that this cuts both ways, if you see a great approval rate for your own stats, don't get complacent and assume you will get an approval, put in the work to submit a strong study permit application!

Hope this helps!

Here to celebrate!

US passport holder, applied for a study permit on March 15. This AM, I got my stage one eligibility letter!

It reads:

""Hello, While the COVID-19 pandemic has presented a number of challenges world-wide, Canada’s whole-of-government approach is aimed at protecting the health of Canadians while minimizing the economic and social impact of restrictions. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada has implemented a temporary two-stage process to provide an update to international students who have not yet been able to provide all the required documents or information needed to have their application fully assessed in time for the fall semester.

You are receiving this notification as an officer has reviewed the information and documents you provided to support your study permit application. Based on this preliminary eligibility assessment, your application has advanced to the next stage of processing.

Additional information and documentation may be required in order to continue processing your application. If we previously requested that you complete biometrics and/or a medical examination and submit a police certificate, please do so as soon as you are able to. If you have not received a request from us for additional information or documents, please await further instructions.

Once we have received all requested information and documents, we will complete our assessment of your application and we will inform you of the final decision (approved or refused) made on your application.

While you await a final decision on your application you may commence your studies online.""

I'm a teensy bit confused because I did have a complete application (US passport holders don't need to present biometrics or police reports, etc.) and they have indicated that the two-stage process would only be used for incomplete applications....

p2huaz,Study Permit,"I got denied again, but this time instead of 2 reasons it's down to 1. Study Permit help please.","This is my letter that I sent with a list of the evidence I provided.

&#x200B;

**Letter of Explanation**

>I was denied a student permit in my previous application due to two reasons: my immigration status and my study plan. This letter is going to address those issues that I didn’t clarify in my initial application, along with the explanation are evidence and a longer letter at the very end if clarification is needed.

&#x200B;

**Study Plan:**

* Average Video Editor (p4), Animator (p5), and Visual Effects Salaries (p6)
   * The comparison shows that I would be paid significantly more as a Visual Effects Artist which requires skills obtained from an Advanced Visual Effects Diploma that Langara provides.
* Letter of Confirmation (p7)
   * This letter from the vice president of Langara states that I have been accepted in Langara with their highest scholarship, justifying the investment and the asset of my abilities contributing to their program.
* My Highschool Diploma (p8), International Baccalaureate Diploma (p9), and University Diploma (p10, p11)
   * Evidence that I have graduated high school and university in the field of film, showing my track record in pursuing my dream of filmmaking.
* Current Resume (p12)
   * Showcasing my abilities, skills, and experience in my current field proving that I am following the trajectory for a video editor to a visual effects artist and animator.

>I have a bachelor's degree in film and cinematography which the previous officer rightfully realized means a diploma is not necessary. However, what I forgot to clarify was that my current bachelor's degree taught me the fundamentals of filmmaking from pre-production to post-production but not animation or visual effects. I require a more advanced education in order to move above a video editor and into a visual effects artist position. Langara is offering a specialized diploma that educates solely on advanced visual effects and animation. What they provide is not possible to obtain on my own or with any institution in my home country. They provide professors within the current visual effects film industry in the hub for post-production which would give current skills and knowledge unavailable anywhere else in the world with this affordable tuition and scholarship.

&#x200B;

**Ties to Home Country:**

* Ubisoft Visual Effects Lighting Artist Philippines Job Posting (p13, p14), Ubisoft Animator Philippines Job Posting (p15, p16, Junior 3D Artist Philippines Job Posting (p17, p18), 2D/3D Designer Philippines Job Posting (p10, p20), GMA New Media Philippines Job Posting (p21), and eJam Cartoonist Philippines Job Posting (p22)
   * Current job postings in the Philippines that require visual effect skills that would be obtained from an Advanced Visual Effects Diploma that Langara provides.
* Property Letter (p23)
   * This letter is from my parents which states that when I go back to the Philippines I will have my own place to stay. It is a letter that dictates that when I need it, the property will be mine.
* Transfer Certificate of Title (p24), Condominium Certificate of Title (p25), and Certificate of Acceptance (p26)
   * Evidence that the properties listed belong to my parents.
* Certification (p27) and Certificate of Management (p28)
   * Letters stating that I have lived in said properties and that I am a registered owner of said properties.

>I have lived in the Philippines and I have the ability to become the sole owner of one of said properties. There are multitudes of jobs in my home country that I will be applying for once I receive the skills, experiences, and abilities that the Advanced Visual Effects Diploma from Langara provides. The Philippines is my home where I plan to start my career surrounded by my family and friends.

&#x200B;

**Immigration Status**

* Current 10 Year B1/B2 USA Visa (p29) and USA Stamp of Entry (p30)
   * Evidence of me legally entering and residing in the United States of America.
* Philippines Government COVID19 Travel Restriction Notice (p31, p32) and COVID19 Status from Official US Government Website (p33)
   * The Philippines government restricted entry for returning overseas Filipinos who are non-Overseas workers, which I am. This warranted an unpredictable extended stay in the United States.
* Current USA Visa Extension USCIS Status (p34), Receipt for Application of Extension of Visa (p35), Appointment Notice for Biometrics from USCIS (p36), and Appointment Notice for Biometrics from USCIS Stamped and Completed (p37)
   * These documents show that I am taking the necessary actions to legally stay in the United States, following their rules and regulations.
* Statement legally allowing my stay in the USA while pending Extension Status (p38)
   * The website states that legally I am allowed to stay in the United States of America while waiting for my pending extension of stay.

>I am legally staying in the United States and I have always followed immigration rules and regulations of all the countries that I have ever visited. COVID19 provided an unexpected restriction that prevented me from returning to my home country. I followed the legal procedure that allows me to stay in the United States for an additional 6 months, letting me stay until October 2021. I would ideally be allowed to enter Canada before then to attend Langara’s September term, however if the process of obtaining a visa requires me to defer to the January term I will leave the United States and return to the Philippines before entering Canada with my legally acquired Visa and Student Permit.

&#x200B;

**End of letter**

&#x200B;

I gave them a lot of evidence and was denied about a week later.

&#x200B;

The reasoning being: 

>I am not satisfied that you will leave Canada at the end of your stay, as stipulated in subsection 216(1) of the IRPR, based on the purpose of your visit.

&#x200B;

I was able to remove the immigration status reason but seem to be unable to address the purpose of visit. I have been accepted into the university and was given a scholarship.

Just a heads up, after 4 months I finally just got my application approved! Fyi I applied mid-June, and did biometrics in July. Got the AIP and August and today I received the biometrics approval letter followed by the actual approval 3 hours later. 

Also to my understanding at least, what I obtained isn't the actual study permit, I just got a travel authorization and I have to claim the actual permit at the border! Thought I'd also get a visa with this, but apparently my country doesn't require a visitor Visa, just the eTa. I'm not really sure what to do now, the eTa is valid until end 2021 since my passport expires then, they're saying if I get a new passport I'll just have to apply for another eTa with the new document, but that shouldn't take nearly as long so yay!

\- I am not satisfied that you will leave Canada at the end of your stay, as stipulated in subsection 216(1) of the IRPR, based on your family ties in Canada and in your country of residence.  

\- Pursuant to paragraph 220(b) of the IRPA, I am not satisfied that you have sufficient and available financial resources, without working in Canada, to maintain yourself and any family members who are accompanying you during your proposed period of study.

I wrote a Letter of Explanation that stated I am going to return to my country of residence after I finish my studies and it was really explicit. 

About financials, I put an account that has a very considerable amount of money, plus I would be living with my sister so I really don't get why they would deny it as I can clearly maintain myself. Is there something to do with who owns the account by any chance?

If you can, I'd really appreciate if you shared any past experiences with any of these issues and how could I solve them to get my next application approved.

Thank you",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/phxeu6/denied_study_permit_what_do_i_do_now/,I guess that the fact you're gonna be living with your sister implies that you might illegally overstay your visit (this is the main reason - its always kind of bad to be living with your relatives with weak family ties back home unless you are adamant on proving otherwise) or might illegally start working to sustain both you and your sister's living expenses.

Since I faced a couple of issues with the two way courier service, I wanted to put out the procedure for ya'll for a smooth process. 

Timeline of events
1) I submitted my application in the end of September 2020. 
2) I did my biometrics before I applied for my visa. 
3) Since indian biometric applications weren't working, I went to another country to submit my biometrics. 
4) once my biometrics were submitted, I received a confirmation of submission within a week. 
5) I received a passport request letter (PRL)in the last week of November. 

Once I received the PRL, I sent a mail to PassportSubmission@vfshelpline.com

They usually take 2-3 business days to revert. Incase they don't feel free to send a follow up email. 

Within 4 days you should receive a payment link. The payment link is only valid for 5 hours so ensure you don't miss the deadline. 

Once the payment is made, you will receive an airway bill number and instructions as to what all needs to be sent (documents+ passport). 

They will also give you a date and time when the courier executive will come and pick up the documents and passport from you. 

Usually, it takes 5-7 working days for the passport to come back with a stamp.

If you know of any crazy timelines where people got their permits in a month or less please do share.,https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/15054xu/what_are_your_miracle_stories/,"My story isn't specifically have to do with Study Permit but PR 

I came to Canada almost 10 years ago. Right after graduating high-school, I came to study. My study was only a 2 years certificate program and after grad, I got my PGWP and worked for 3 years. Unfortunately, at the time, my score wasn't high enough to get a PR. My education was too short for much points and my company at the time wouldn't sponsor me. 

So I went back home confused what to do with my life, but my parents convinced me to go back to school for a bachelors to get enough points for PR. So I did but covid happened. No draws were happening and my 3 years was up to be eligible for CEC. Then the huge draw for CEC happened at 75 pts and I missed my eligibility by a week. I was so heartbroken...

After graduating with a bachelors, I had 490 pts but because of covid, minimum draw pts were well over 500 and no where in sight for my turn. I waited in the pool for over 2 years. Fast-forward, I finally got my invitation early this year and now am expecting my PR card soon.  

Never lose sight of your goal and hopefully my story will give you some hope for your future 🙏"

So my plan as not only increase the score by studying but also get one more year of skilled work through 2 years working part time.

Will this part time experience not count?

li7dza,Study Permit,What happens after PGWP?,"Just to clarify, I haven't made any moves yet to apply for a program nor student permit. I just want to know as much as possible before I make any move, so I can plan ahead and anticipate pitfalls. 

1. In reality, how long does it take to process PR while on PGWP? Would it be possible to have it in less than a year? 
2. How soon can you apply for PR while on PGWP? 
3. What if your PGWP has ended before you are granted PR? How soon do you have to come back to your country? Is there a grace period? 
4. If you had to come back after your PGWP, will your PR application continue on or will it be cancelled? 

I am doing my own research on this too but I want to hear actual experiences about this possible conflict. I see a lot of students coming back to their home countries after studying in Canada due to expired PGWP. 

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/li7dza/what_happens_after_pgwp/,"There's no direct relationship between having a PGWP and applying for PR, having a PGWP does not give you the right for PR or something like that, so there isn't a fixed period on how long it will take to get your PR after PGWP.

Your ability to apply for PR will depend on whether your individual CRS score is good enough to compete against others on the Express Entry pool: some might have enough score after their Canadian education, and some might need additional score from more canadian work experience or a second language test, but you do need to have at least 1 year of canadian work experience to apply under CEC stream for example (though there are other streams as well if you don't). 454 was the cutoff score during last draw for CEC stream under Express Entry.

Depending on the scenario, you might be able to apply for another work permit called BOWP once your PR is in process. If for some reason you have to leave Canada, you can update your residencial address with IRCC on your application and continue the process outside Canada.

“Passengers arriving from a county other than the USA are not allowed to enter until 21 January 2021”

Has anyone travelled to Canada recently using Lufthansa Airlines?

There is something wrong with their website or it is just that they are not allowing international students to travel via Lufthansa. Btw the error message is correct that travels are restricted until January 21st. But international students are exempt as long as their DLI is on the list of covid readiness list.

Edit: I am not sure how they can even validate the details of your visa. I mean they shouldn't even have access to such data. I wouldn't worry about this.

I am a Philippines passport holder. I am going to Canada to study a advanced diploma in film.

1. Immigration status. This is most likely referring to my staying in the States on an extended tourist visa.
2. Purpose of my visit. Most likely they don't believe I'm going there strictly for studying.

2a. My background in film with my current abilities and job history. My  desire to learn visual effects due to the high demand in the industry.  Job possibilities in countries outside of Canada.

Long time lurker here, but now I need some advice on how to proceed with this.

I applied for my visa last week, biometrics updated day before yesterday, and today, I received my rejection for the following reasons.

I am not satisfied that you will leave Canada at the end of your stay as required by paragraph R216(1)(b) of the IRPR (https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/ section-216.html). I am refusing your application because you have not established that you will leave Canada, based on the following factors: 

•    The purpose of your visit to Canada is not consistent with a temporary stay given the details you have provided in your application.         
•    Pursuant to paragraph 220(a) of the IRPA, I am not satisfied that you have sufficient and available financial resources, without working in Canada, to pay the tuition fees for the course or program of studies that you intend to pursue.         
•    Pursuant to paragraph 220(b) of the IRPA, I am not satisfied that you have sufficient and available financial resources, without working in Canada, to maintain yourself and any family members who are accompanying you during your proposed period of study.

My Background: 

- Non SDS from India
- Gave enough proof of funds (100k CAD liquid funds and 400k CAD property assets) 
- Sponsored by Parents 
- Gave enough reasons to come back

Also, one thing I didn't submit was optional document IMM 5257 (Application for TRV) because in the main form, it said to submit only if the answers to some questions were yes. Could this be the reason? But it should come under lack of documents right and not a straight-up rejection?

- pursuing your studies online is not an option at your school or not possible from your home country (due to internet restrictions or bandwidth limitation)

So if your classes are online, they can deny entry."
o88boa,Study Permit,Arriving in Toronto as an international student enrolled in BC,"Hi,

I am an international student who is planning to arrive in Toronto Pearson (YYZ) in the middle of August to fulfil my hotel quarantine requirement (the vaccine I have taken is not approved so I need to quarantine). After my initial 3 days of quarantine in Toronto, I plan to take a domestic flight to Vancouver/Kelowna where my university is and where I will finish the remaining 11 days of quarantine. My questions are

\-Will there be any issues at immigration to collect my study permit, as I would be arriving in Ontario and my university is in British Columbia

\-I have heard that Ontario was/is planning to restrict the arrival of international students, is this true? My  university is not in Ontario anyways and I just need to quarantine, so will there be any issues?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/o88boa/arriving_in_toronto_as_an_international_student/,"Reply to first question: Aren't there any flights directly to Vancouver from your country? If not, then there won't be any issues. You will be issued your study permit at Toronto airport in this case.

rqj1ck,Study Permit,Study permit extension refused due to a very stupid mistake…,"TL;DR 
I got this email a couple days back and my inland study permit extension has been refused. Here’s the reason “A letter was sent to you on 2021-11-20 requesting education transcripts. These documents were required to be submitted by 2021-12- 19. As we have not received any documentation, your application is refused.” 

My original study permit was set to expire on Nov 30, 2021 and I applied for an extension about 3 months beforehand. About 2 months in IRCC asked me to send my original education transcripts. As soon as i got that letter I asked my university to send the transcripts which arrived in a week by snail mail. I scanned and uploaded it online before my permit expired. Or so I thought!! Apparently the additional document was just uploaded but not sent to IRCC. 

So now the original study permit is expired and I’m out of status. I thought I was gonna be able to graduate in 5 months but looks like that’s not happening anymore.

What can I do now? Has anyone had a similar experience in the past? Do I need to drop all the classes for the next semester?
 
Please help!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/rqj1ck/study_permit_extension_refused_due_to_a_very/,You may still have time to file for a new study permit with the additional requested documents.

15k61lz,Study Permit,School wants to withdraw my admission due to not receiving a response from IRCC,"Hi guys, my semester begins on September 5.

y2yppi,Study Permit,Can visa officers check bank account?,Can visa officers contact a personal bank to check an applicant’s bank account?,https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/y2yppi/can_visa_officers_check_bank_account/,"To the users who insist in erroneously saying that banks don't help visa officers verify the authenticity of bank statements, here's a video from a UK show about the UK border and immigration departments, showing an employee of the UK High Commission in Delhi, India, calling the bank the applicant has an account with and is able to verify with the bank that some of the transactions that appear on the document the applicant submitted (namely salary deposits), didn't actually happened in real life, and so, to confirm, with the help of the local bank, and through a phone call, that bank statement was fraudulent (including getting a written confirmation from the bank manager, who sent to the UK High Commission that client's real bank statement, where it was evident the one submitted by the applicant was fake):

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swBo4em1KTs&t=1020s&ab\_channel=RealResponders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swBo4em1KTs&t=1020s&ab_channel=RealResponders)

(minute 17:00 to 23:05 of the video above; spoiler: that applicant got a 10 year ban from the UK for having provided a fake bank statement and a fake degree; and he was arrested by the local police, bailed and charged with fraud).

Yes, that was a UK visa application, not a Canadian one, but it illustrates the work visa officers around the word do to verify the authenticity of the documents the applicants submit (1 of the reasons why applications take so long to be processed, as it does take time to verify every document, every detail).

Also, for those who jumped into insisting on providing incorrect information about this without even reading the case law at the Federal Court, from 1 of the comments on this thread, it states:

&#x200B;

*""\[3\]               In support of his visa application, he submitted a bank statement from the Société tunisienne de Banque Bank (STD Bank) in Tunis.*

*\[4\]*               ***On January 10, 2011, an official from the Canadian Embassy in Tunisia contacted the STD Bank to verify the authenticity of a number of bank statements from Tunisian students, including that of the applicant. The STD Bank confirmed that only three of all the bank statements provided were authentic. That of the applicant was not mentioned.***

*\[5\]               On December 7, 2012, an immigration officer met with the applicant for an explanation on the bank statement in question. According to the immigration officer’s report, the applicant stated that his father obtained the bank statement and that he was not, therefore, responsible for submitting a fraudulent document.""*

Again, this was a Canadian case law, in the Federal Court of Canada. So these are 2 examples to demonstrate that yes, officers to backgrounds checks on the applicants, including verifying the authenticity of documents (including - but not limited to- bank statements submitted by the applicant).

It's more useful to learn how things work at a visa office and what the correct information is, than coming on Reddit and insisting on spreading misinformation over and over again, and jump into insulting people, just because the individual engaging in that behaviour doesn't know what the visa officer's work entails and how the cooperation of local institutions not only happens on a daily basis, but it's crucial to catch non-genuine applicants, those attempting to misrepresent themselves and commit fraud in any way (and thus, break Canadian law and be deemed inadmissible to Canada due to misrepresentation, under section 40 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.)"

One thing about your case , is that you're currently doing a degree,  and yet you're applying for a diploma program in Canada, 

Perhaps the immigration officer does not feel that this program is inline with the natural academic progression that would follow after your degree.

And you're using this diploma only for immigration purposes.

After getting accepted into T8 Canadian MBA Programs back in January 2020 I was so excited and I was looking forward to coming to Canada in July/August 2020. But Covid-19 destroyed all my plans and put me in immense stress and frustration by piling misery in terms of loss of opportunity and incurring monthly financial losses.

So I started scouring the internet and ever since I have been a passive reader of ImmigrationCanada and it has helped in keeping myself updated with the latest developments and learn from other personal experiences.

Hence, I feel this post is a forced mandate on my conscious so as to give back to this community and help others with any information I can.

Below given is the timeline and some additional information for people to understand my Study Permit application and its difficulties during such testing times:

* Applying along with a Dependent via SDS Route
* Original Admit Term: Fall 2020
* Deferred Admit Term (due to Covid-19): Winter 2021
* Medical Submission: 29th June 2020
* Student Application Submission along with Visitor Visa Application (for dependent): 21st July 2020
* Biometric Request received on: 22nd July 2020
* Biometric Registered on: 15th November 2020
* An oddity experienced (details below) in application update on: 16th December 2020
* Passport Request received on: 1st January 2021 (Yup! Great start to the New Year)
* Submitted details to VFS for Two-Way Passport Courier Service (Cost -> CAD $65): 2nd January 2021
* Pick-up service details given on: 11th January 2021
* Passport Picked Up on: 12th January 2021
* Passport Stamped and Delivered on: 16th January 2021

**Description of few hiccups along the way:**

Let me start by saying for any old applicants with similar date of submission as mine -- Hold On. It will work out for you as it worked out for me in 6 months time. There will be frustrations and regrets of both the known and unknown nature but -- Hold On and Be Patient.

Oddity on 16th December 2020 was that even after giving Up-Front medicals, I got an update in my system asking for another medical which was rather shocking and frustrating too since I had already paid for the same back in June. I reached out to IRCC via Webforms almost every 4-5 days explaining the error made at their end and becoming frustrated by thinking that either I go ahead and do a medical or lose out on time since my course starts in January 2021. In the end, I kept patience (and money in my pocket) by not taking another medical and deciding to do it if I did not get an update by 15th January 2021.

After submitting passport collection and stamping request, I didn't get any reply from VFS Global for 9 days straight. I reached out to them once in the middle but appreciated the fact that at least I got my passport request and remained patient.

**Conclusion (Especially for Students):**

Immigrating as a student is never easy and the process itself it very stressful. Add a pandemic to that mix and you have a cocktail of disaster which I have drank and lived through to tell you this:

For all the stress I took, money I lost and the opportunity I lost to complete program 4 months earlier; It was not worth it at all. I should have been more thankful to God (whether you believe in one is up to you) that I was safe and healthy through it all.

I have started my course online already and soon I will travel to Canada. It is not ideal but then what in life is? Hence don't take too much stress and concentrate on things which are working out for you. You will get your Study Permit soon. You will Come to Canada. You will Pursue Your Dreams.

Stay Strong And Stay Safe.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/kz2shg/finally_acquired_my_student_permit_for_travel/,"Hi, may i ask from what country are you to be able to take the SDS route? :)"
wyjgn5,Study Permit,Friend went to school without a study permit,"My friend took a university course during this summer with an eTA while waiting for her study permit to be processed. She made an error and thought with her eTA she’s allowed to take a semester since it would be done before the 6 month rule applies - Not knowing that it meant the entire program had to be finished in under 6 months to not need a study permit. Upon her arrival she even stated to the immigration officer that she came here to study. 

This violation only came to light three weeks into the semester when she was talking to a student advisor, and upon learning that she’s non-compliant she immediately dropped her course’s. 

So now she has a letter of introduction and needs to reenter a Canadian border to get her study permit. Will this affect her attaining her study permit when she goes to the border to talk with an immigration officer? Will she get kicked out of the country? 

Also I have to ask, I get that in the end it is her fault for not being thorough. But how does a university not have some of sort of layers to avoid things like this from happening?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/wyjgn5/friend_went_to_school_without_a_study_permit/,"That is sad to hear. The school messed up, they should not have let her study without confirming a permit. I would strongly suggest your friend consult with a good lawyer BEFORE going to the border. Better yet, seek other options than going to the border. The CBSA could refuse a study permit for unauthorized study within last 6 months and tell her to leave Canada. Did the unauthorized study end more than 6 months ago? They may even issue a removal order against her. Always always be extra careful before flagpoling. 

Unfortunately, while not all DLI are like this, the common thread appears to be that most DLIs do not really care about international student, they see dollar signs when they see intl students. Also, students need to realize the DLIs do not have the student's best interest in mind. When it comes time to do work (such as providing follow up services after graduation) or if there is immigration issue, the DLI will usually tell the student they are SOL. 

Best of luck to your friend.

oykiug,Study Permit,Is it true that if I get admission in Montreal then getting post study work permit would be hard?,"I'm basically looking at a 2 year Pg diploma course in Montreal(which also has a coop). After then, I'm planning to spend rest of my time in Toronto on post study work visa. Is it true that I would face difficulty doing that? One of my friends said that Montreal has their own rules and regulations and they'd make it very hard for you to get a work visa. Didn't made any sense to me but I thought I'd post it here since I can't find anything similar anywhere else.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/oykiug/is_it_true_that_if_i_get_admission_in_montreal/,"The post-graduation work permit is the same across all of Canada including Quebec/Montreal and Toronto. Permanent immigration and those work permits that require a Labour Market Impact Assessment (not the one you asked about) are indeed quite different within the province of Quebec, but if your plan is to resettle in Toronto after graduation, this shouldn't affect you. Which system applies to you depends on whether you intend to live inside or outside Quebec as a permanent resident or as a holder of a work permit subject to the LMIA requirement, not where you study. (Once you have finally become a permanent resident, you are subsequently allowed to change your mind and move either way across the Quebec border, but in order for your status to be secure, your intent before that point has to be consistent with the chosen immigration pathway throughout the process.)

To study in Quebec you will need the province's approval as well as the federal government's, but that is pretty routine if you follow the procedures quickly and correctly.

The non-Quebec system for permanent immigration will recognize a university degree or work experience from Quebec the same as it would from anywhere else in Canada. The reverse is not true (the Quebec system treats education and experience from the rest of Canada differently)."

muqh46,Study Permit,Worried About my Study Permit application," Hi everyone, hope you are safe and healthy. this is my first time  applying for Canadian visa / study permit and my first post in this forum.   
 

i heard in many forums and websites that the approval rate every year decreases from 75 in 2016/2015 to around 60% in 2020   
 

i spent days writing my LOE and providing all details about my study  plan / background and future plans with my ties to home country. but  hearing refusals stories from many applicants kinda made me worried.   
 

this is my profile   
 

23 years old - no gaps in education   
 

study permit in turkey, Sweden and internship permit in Denmark   
 

previous travel history to 10 countries in Europe  
 

3.73 gpa and 7.0 ielts .. 43,000 cad available for proof of funds ( affidavit of support with my father's saving account )   
 

current intern in the biggest company in terms of commercial film and marketing in my country   
 

my field of study is the same as my prior and current internship and the choice of program in Canada.   
 

do you guys think i have high chances of getting my study permit  approval. i am worried since i am from an African country and according to stats Canada  accepts one application out of 4 in Africa.  approval rate around 27%  
 

would appreciate the help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/muqh46/worried_about_my_study_permit_application/,"I come from an african country and I was accepted as well.

I can tell you something though, the longer you are waiting the better because it means they are actually going through your profile and still found no reason to reject you. I personally think you have a good chance just be sure that you might get rejected.

even if you did get rejected its not the end of the world. I was like you at one point but what matters is what you do with your life.

my background:

My bachelors is in the social sciences BUT i managed A career shift as a Data Analyst. Right now, i’m a data analyst at Deloitte and plan to stay in the company for about a year before applying as a student in Canada. 

Planning to take a 1 year Big Data Analytics PG Certificate in Ontario.

Thanks folks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/n8vs9d/1_year_pgwp_to_pr_success_stories_anyone/,"I did a one year program and got my PR approved yesterday. Having said that, let me tell you upfront that it wasn’t an easy journey. I didn’t find employment in my field and I had to take up a random Noc B job which would help me add Canadian work experience and points for my PR. I did enjoy the job as a liquor store supervisor (still work there) but that’s not what I set out to do in the first place.

But then again, I was in communications and had no prior experience. You might have it easier with your prior experience and the field that you’re into.

I’d say it’s a gamble, you can take it if you feel that you’re up for the challenge. If you wish to secure your future without gambling then you’re better off taking up a two year course. The mental stress just isn’t worth it. It’s definitely doable and depends on what you feel would be a good option for your life."
js5dec,Study Permit,"Gap Between BS and MSc, is it a factor?","I did my BS in 2013 and since then I have been working in the tech industry with continuously paid job roles.

Will this be an issue for university or embassy while applying for a student permit? 

I have 3.0 GPA which is 70% and recently got 8.0(8.5,8,7,7.5) in IELTS academic. 


Edit: Added GPA and IELTS score.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/js5dec/gap_between_bs_and_msc_is_it_a_factor/,"Dont think universities care about job. But for MSc in Canada, you need strong research potential and you need to convince a professor who is going to oversee your research (even if you are self-funded).So I would suggest you to contact professors before applying so that you dont get the bad news after applying. CGPA can be overlooked with your job experience. But research potential is very important.

For study permit, At least you did continuous jobs which were paid. I had a 1 year 4 month gap between by graduation and job start (6 months for GRE prep and exam, 8 months for job search), followed by 2.5 years of job.

I submitted my GRE scores as well during application for study permit so that they don't get confused.In your case, explain reasonably why the 7 years was necessary for your professional growth. Now that you are an experienced professional, doing an Msc will completent your job experience...something like this.

w1yhg6,Study Permit,Getting my visa in time for fall,"Hey guys!

I applied for a student visa from Malaysia on the 27th of May, Biometrics done and uploaded on the 9th of June. From then till now there has been no update/changes to my application and my school term will start on the 6th of September. They have not requested for my medical aswell and Malaysia is a country where one is required for the visa. 

I am worried I will not receive my visa on time, especially with all the talks of delays and backlogs etc. My school term starts on the 6th of September but I would preferably like to be in Canada by the end of August to attend the orientation as well as accustom myself to the dorms and campus.

Have you checked the admission deadlines for the new community college you want to transfer to in the Fall? You could reach out to an International Student Advisor at the new school and get their advice.

It’s fairly common for students to take courses at a community college due to academic probation and then transfer back to the original program once the GPA is back up. There must be something in place for international students in this scenario. Do reach out to the international office of the new college and they should be able to help you out.

You then can try to kill two birds with one stone by doing famil flights with people from the general public (tours etc) so they pay for the plane rental from the flight school. You can also look into becoming a bush pilot (flying deliveries up north). Basically you have to be willing to go where the demand is to log your hours to work your way up.

Dear VISA officer:
I am writing to apply for a student visa to study in Canada for having been accepted as a full-time student at the ________School of ________ in Vancouver, Canada with a program on Human Resources Management.

I am __________________, a citizen of India and a native born resident of the Philippines, completed my Bachelor of Science in Business Administration Major in Marketing Management Studies at the ___________ last March 2019. The course I took was meant to help develop skills for entrepreneurial or corporate work in marketing management. A year before my college graduation, I interned as a Marketing Associate for a local radio station in ____ City, the (*company name*). After graduating, I worked as a Customer Service Representative in a Business Process Outsourcing Company here in ______ since January 2020, for a US Financial Institution where I gained so much insight about banking operations. Now, I wish to pursue my studies internationally since my parents, who take care a 40-year lending business here, assured me of financial support in all of my four-year stay in Canada. 
Why Canada? It is because Canada enjoys a towering standard of living with an enriched culture and diversity that is quite alluring to international students like me. Although there are plenty of Universities that can offer a Master’s Degree in Human Resource here in the Philippines, I believe that studying abroad is a life-enriching experience. Aside from that, Canadian colleges and universities have some of the lowest university tuition fees compared to other countries abroad.
_____, unlike other institutions, incorporates certification processes into the learning curriculum. This means that _____students will graduate with the necessary credentials and documentation to pursue the career of their dreams (___School of _____)
Furthermore, I wish to get back into academics and pursue Human Resources Management Program to further deepen and refine my expertise in the world of business. Based on my extensive research, there are so much potential career options in the field of Human Resource including Recruiting and Placement jobs such as recruiters, interviewers, head hunters, test administrators, and employment managers, which transcends to what I am truly passionate with.
Since I am still young and gradually learning through experience, this once in a lifetime opportunity will surely broaden my worldview and help me ace what I really hope to achieve after finishing the program—to return back to my home country, the Philippines; apply what skills I have learned in my four-year study and become the Human Resource Manager of the ________ Corporation, our lending company in _____. (Please refer to the letter of guarantee attached with this plan). I aspire to excel in the corporate ladder and make a lifelong career out of the degree I have chosen. Having a degree is highly respected in the Philippines, more so earning an international degree. It already is a huge advantage given my background in Marketing. I am hoping that you will take my application with a positive response.

Very truly yours,


Full name
Applicant",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/o0pb4w/study_visa_denied/,"purpose of study not detailed. The letter is not convincing the reader why you chose that program. You need to specify which skills you will get from your program that will help you climb the corporate ladder when you return home. Also do not submit a letter that is identical to your sibling, write your own format.

Add proof of funds in your letter, home ties and specific career aspirations upon return to the Philippines. State the connection between your chosen program and the career upgrade you want for yourself when you come back.

Depending on our age you need to establish that you are rooted here in the Philippines.

&#x200B;

This part is confusing and vague:

>I wish to get back into academics and pursue Human Resources Management Program to further deepen and refine my expertise in the world of business.

HR is very specific for you to say you want to deepen and refine your expertise in the world of business."
osrlqo,Study Permit,"Study permit rejected because The agent was not sure I would leave Canada based on my purpose of visit, Family ties, and financial status","Hello, as the title says, my application was rejected on those grounds. It says I am welcome to re-apply, how do I prove that I will leave the country? For family ties, I have no family in Canada, all of my family is in my home country. My purpose of visit is to study. My father is the one who is financially supporting me and I provided proof that the money is there to put me through school. What can I show to prove all of this? Thank you.

I also applied for a visitor visa for my father in conjunction with this application.

Did you state in your letter that you do not have relatives in Canada and your entire immediate family is in your home country? I think it would help if you had the same address. Applying for a visitor visa for your father did not affect your application.

For the financial status, I learned that it would be a big help if you have your own money in the bank in addition to your father’s funds - both should be stated in the letter with proofs as attachments. This is very normal especially for third world country applicants. Unless you are in high school or taking a bachelor’s degree, then I don’t think they would look for your funds.

The best thing to have a clarity of these would be to purchase the caips notes before reapplying. It will give all of your answers to why your permit was rejected."

11bxxzx,Study Permit,What are my options?,"Hi everyone, I’m (20, F) looking for some immigration advice and suggestions for my current circumstances. 
So for context, I’m from Iran and I’m an international student in Canada. Got my high school diploma here and I’m currently doing a bachelors degree in Ontario. I’m financially dependent on my father, and he uses my financial dependency as leverage for financial and emotional blackmail. 
I’ve heard everything about bearing it and buttering him up so he still supports me and I’m not here for that. 
I’m here because I know I’m on borrowed time with him and that my relationship with him has caused my already shit mental health to deteriorate even more because of the abuse (yes it can still happen with distance as long as there’s a power imbalance that’s taken advantage of). 
I want advice specifically so I can stay where I am even if he cuts off all support. I know if I could afford my tuition (and was guaranteed to be able to continue my education cause I can pay for it) I would not hesitate to completely separate myself from him. I work full time, make 40 cents above minimum wage, and one year of my tuition (21k) is more than I can afford even working full-time. There is little to no financial aid available where I go.
I’ve considered applying for refugee status because I’m openly queer and we are persecuted in Iran (another point of anxiety about having to go back). And I’ve also considered lines of credit with a canadian co-signer. Please comment any other ideas that you have! Anything but “bear it” is appreciated :D

Edit 1: I came here for education and because I want a better life than being in an abusive situation within reach, and being under a fascist government. I hope anyone else (especially the user who was so frustrated my study permit was approved in the first place and deleted their comment later) who has a problem with my presence here keeps their frustrations to themself and goes the other way. You're taking up space in this post that is not related to my problem.

TLDR: I’m stuck with an abusive parent because of finances and impossible tuition fees and I’m looking for ways to be able to stay in canada without relying on him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/11bxxzx/what_are_my_options/,"Short term options: Have you looked into applying for private bank loans? I know loans wouldn't be ideal, but they might give you some breathing room. Without a degree and skilled work experience you are likely not eligible to immigrate permanently yet. 

Longer term options: Express Entry will probably be your best bet to become a permanent resident. Look into the Canadian Experience Class requirements and make sure you plan your future, as best you can, to become eligible. You can also look at provincial nominee programs.

u0la5j,Study Permit,How to prove strong ties and that I will return? Advice appreciated,"Hello all, I have been admitted to a Master's program in Nova Scotia and am working on gathering documentation for my study permit application. I am looking for advice on how to prove that I have strong ties to my home country and will leave Canada after my program. A bit of background on my situation:

1. My country of citizenship is India
2. I grew up in the UAE and have never lived in India.
3. I have been in the US since 2013 - I completed my Bachelor's degree here and am working currently.
4. My parents currently live in India but returned there from the UAE only two years ago. This means that when I traveled to visit my parents, I went to the UAE, not India. I have not been to India since 2016, and even before then I traveled to India very intermittently. My home base was the UAE and I would visit the UAE once or twice a year before the pandemic. The last time I visited the UAE was late 2019. I have not traveled outside the US since the pandemic began.
5. My parents finances are strong and they own multiple homes in India. However, my name does not show up in any of the paperwork for these properties.
6. My brother is a Canadian PR - does this affect my study permit application?

I think maybe my case is a little unconventional so I am worried. My father will be paying for my education and will be giving me bank statements as proof of funds. I will definitely try to be as clear as possible in the letter of explanation as to how my degree will benefit me when I return to India and what I intend to do in India after I complete my Master's degree. In addition, I can include documents showing my parents properties in India. Is this enough? Is there any other form of evidence I can give? Again, since I have never lived in India I have no financial history/assets/etc of my own there - only my parents'.

I filled out no as he is not traveling with me. We will be going to different provinces and he would need a separate study permit. Could this be a potential issue?

xaxg33,Study Permit,Work hour restrictions?,"I’m an international undergraduate at SFU, Vancouver and as most of you might know international students have a restriction of working only 20 hours/week. But the thing is I can work more than 20 hours if I have a job on campus. 

I am working 2 jobs, one on-campus and one off. At the off campus job I restrict the hours I work there to 20 or under. Additionally I work another 15-20 hours on campus. This makes a cumulative of under 40 hours/week. 

I just want to know, is this going to be a problem by any chance? Can I work 20 off campus and work up to another 20 on? Also, what if I start working 20 hours off campus and another 40 on campus?

cqwd3v,Study Permit,Study permit application rejected twice,"I'm just venting here as I lost all sense of rational when it comes to the visa officers.

I'm a student from the UAE and I got accepted in Carleton University in Ottawa, ON. I applied for my study permit the first time on the 31st of May and got a rejection on the 3rd of July for the following reasons:

1. Immigration Status
2. Personal Assets
3. Financial Status

Personal assets didn't make sense as I showed them assets owned by my father in Egypt. Immigration status didn't make sense. Financial status made some sense because the bank statements I showed sort of had less than the amount needed for a year worth of tuition at the time. So I didn't give up and I applied again.

Applied for the second time on the 18th of July and got a rejection on the 14th of August for the following reasons:

1. Travel History
2. Personal Assets
3. Financial Status

Given that ""Immigration Status"" did not show up again I presumed it was cleared. No what pissed me off is that even though I had about $53,000 in my parents' bank statements when my course was only $36,000, they still mentioned financial status as a reason for the rejection. How much money do they want? Personal assets still didn't make sense because they were the same assets that my father owned in Egypt. Travel history shouldn't be an issue for an 18 year old student traveling for the first time. It just doesn't make sense. I just didn't have the opportunity to travel anywhere before I got the chance to study at Canada, what's so suspicious about this? Why are they turning away genuine students? I had a SOP and a study plan of what I wanted to do after my degree. I had home ties that included a family business and military service. That still wasn't enough apparently because the visa officer was not satisfied that I was going to leave at the end of my stay.

I don't want to sound entitled but I just don't think it's fair. I earned a place at a reputable university with a scholarship and to them this isn't enough to prove that I'm a genuine student.

EDIT: I already paid for the Fall 2019 semester so having financial status come up as a reason was confusing. What's also confusing is that my friends with similar situations related to financial status and travel history got their visa approved the first time so its a bit frustrating.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/cqwd3v/study_permit_application_rejected_twice/,">No what pissed me off is that even though I had about $53,000 in my bank statements when my course was only $36,000, they still mentioned financial status as a reason for the rejection.

What did you actually show as proof? Can you describe the document exactly? Do you have an affidavit attached to the statement?

>Travel history shouldn't be an issue for an 18 year old student traveling for the first time. It just doesn't make sense. I just didn't have the opportunity to travel anywhere before I got the chance to study at Canada, what's so suspicious about this? 

Because there is no evidence of you ever returning from a trip abroad. Really, if you have never been abroad on holiday and returned etc, there is absolutely no way for immigration to tell whether you would leave after your stay or not.

>I had home ties that included a family business and military service. 

If you have military obligation, you need to at least complete them before university or you have an official document of your confirmed enlistment date that would show ties as well."

Secondly, it is highly unlikely that you can return by September. KW just entered phase 2 last week, and the GTA isnt in phase 2 yet. the IRCC is backed up to god knows when, so it is highly unlikely that any government agency is fully functioning at the normal expected time frames right now.

Obviously, this isn't the ideal situation but I don't want to defer my studies and from what it seems like, the OWP has a longer processing time than the SP, which could slow down my application further.

2) enough funds for living expenses (which i think is the CAD10k on the canadian website, and then the CAD833/month)

in your case, i think if you have enough funds to cover whichever is more expensive between the two (10k/year + 833/month vs 15026/8 months), you should be OK. it also wouldn't hurt to show any other accounts you have in excess of these minimum amounts to show that financing your study will not be an issue.

There is no reason of refusing your study permit.  Anyways you can apply to any university in Canada. once you get an admission you go ahead and apply for a study permit. You have to provide that you actually applied for your the program. With of course a letter of acceptance in hand. Besides that you must show proof of income. Like how you gonna support yourself financially during you program (2 or 4 years). However during the pandemic most of the universities have cancelled their on site classes and many programs are going100% online. So if you applying for a study permit for a program that has no classes (online only) you will not get your study permit. Even if you get it, your entry to Canada won't be authorized.
Edited: Not having a job or owning a property a broad not always a requirement since you are still young and a student. For a study permit having financial support is always a requirement. You have to show how your parents gonna support you financially. Their bank account for example. Also you can open a Canadian bank account and transfer money in it this is always a great idea."

1. Masters if you want to work as engineer and gain professional engineering licensure - PEng.

I'd got for a professional masters (MEng) or research masters (MASc) if I were in your shoes. The first type is usually self-funded (no scholarship through the university), the second type is usually funded through your PI, the professor who supervises your research work. Some universities have masters programmes in renewable energy or sustainable energy engineering.
3. No concrete idea about this. I know project managers with a background in engineering, they worked as engineers for years, got promoted to junior project manager or something and then got their MBA while working full-time.
4. As I said previously, I doubt it's a good idea career-wise for someone with little work experience to do an MBA in general, and more specifically, for someone new in Canada with no local work experience to do an MBA.

igs1tz,Study Permit,Not sure if my Study Permit extension got approved.,"Hello, guys. Hope you are all having a great week like you all deserve!

Anyhoo, on to the matter. I got an email this morning saying that I got a message in my CIC Application for Study Permit Extension. So I opened up my application on the [cic.gc.ca](https://cic.gc.ca) website and there indeed was a new message. This message contained a letter that stated I need to give a Medical Exam conducted by an authorized panel physician. Okay, no biggie. 

But here's the thing that confuses me. On my application, it says that a final decision has been made on my file, and the decision is that my application is approved.

Study permit extensions need to be submitted before the study permit expires; not 2 years after it expired.

It wouldn't be a study permit extension. It needs to be a brand new study permit application (not a renewal of the one you already had and expired 2 years ago).

You'd need a new letter of acceptance from the University, new proof of funds, showing, again, ties to your home country and your intent to leave Canada at the end of your stay in Canada, etc.

Since you had a study permit before and you interrupted your studies you should also include on your new study permit application a letter of explanation about that, on why you failed to actively pursue your studies, on why you want to return to Canada now, 2 years after your study permit expired, to complete your studies and on how this time you intend to complete your studies."

rvqi5w,Study Permit,Canada Study Visa with Pas Ban from the UK,"Title edit: Past** Ban

In 2011, due to poor planning and misinformation, I was denied entry to the UK and I later found out they tacked on a 10 year ban (this is the minimum) for “deception”. (lying about what I was going to be doing- work holiday for no pay). I didn’t have the money to try to fight it at 18 years old (lots of confusing answers from immigration who originally told me I had no ban, then when I applied for a tourist visa, they said there was a ban). The ban expired in 2021. 

This incident didn’t come up on my any of my visa application to South Korea. But my brain is full of anxiety and am worrying it could come up on my application for studying in Canada.

I am starting the process of applying for a student visa, and I was trying to figure out the logistics of travelling to Canada for the first time. I previously studied in the U.S. and since I did not have a local bank account then in my home country, my parents gave me cash in U.S. dollars which I then deposited into a U.S. bank account when I opened one. The school helped us with that. Would I have to do the same before coming to Canada, i.e., simply convert the leftover funds I have after paying tuition and housing costs (probably student apartment on campus) into Canadian dollars and then physically bring that with? Are there any downsides to this? For e.g. landing at the airport and then getting a ride from there to accommodations etc? I know credit/debit cards are super common everywhere so just hoping that I won't be too inconvenienced upon arrival and opening a Canadian account. (I am from a developing country and we use debit cards of course, but cash is still a very acceptable form of payment).

Also, if anyone has recommendations on the best banks for students please let me know. I used Bank of America in the U.S. and for the duration of my studies paid no fees to maintain the account, plus as long as I had a $1500 monthly balance after graduation/continually deposited money into the account I didn't have to pay maintenance fees, so it was like having a free account.

14n98hl,Other,"Emigrating from the UK: Canada is extremely tough, but worth it.","I moved to Canada with my then-husband in 2018. It wasn't really a properly planned move, even though I'd known I wanted to live here since I was a kid, the opportunity came along very quickly and we just committed to it.

My experience of Canada has been challenging but in the end it has been worth it, and I knew that when I was looking to move I would have benefitted from some personal insight so I thought I would offer some thoughts here.

Canada has some amazing opportunities, if you're fortunate enough to be able to get Permanent Residency then you really are set up for life here.

Some things to consider (in hindsight for me).....

1. Make sure you have a clear idea of what you want to do for work, and ensure you know what you need to get into the jobs market here because it can be very difficult. Canada, for all its openness, isn't the greatest to find work as you often need either Canadian work experience or Canadian education, so just make sure you plan for all employment eventualities.
2. Be proactive. I was not proactive when I moved here, I acted as if I was still in the UK and I very much wasn't. Circumstances forced me into having to adapt very quickly, but once I did, things like employment insurance and extended health benefits (when you're working) make a huge difference.
3. Find your healthcare providers. Finding a family doctor here can be hard. My experience was both very lucky and somewhat unfortunate. I was hospitalised with diabetes symptoms and the doctor who treated me referred me to a family doctor he knew. When I started psychiatry, I also got referred to a doctor. It's all about relationship building. Canadians won't necessarily offer insight, but if you ask, they are extremely empathetic and generous.
4. Canada is bloody enormous. I landed in Ontario and spent a year in Toronto and then moved out to Vancouver. I drove across Canada in the middle of January, which was an amazing experience, and it put into perspective just how big Canada is. This weekend I'm in Kamloops, which is a 4-hour drive from Vancouver and not even halfway to Alberta. It can be ridiculous.
5. Canadians, despite what people think, are not endlessly happy. But they are sincere, accepting and compassionate.
6. Canadians are not Brits nor are they Americans. This may sound ridiculous to point out, but Canadians are very much their own people. They are not as calculated as Brits, and not as ""manifest destiny"" as Americans. They are extremely proud of their country, but at the same time more measured. I love them.
7. Canada will try and kill you. I've recently gotten into stargazing and have been driving out to look at the stars, away from city light. In most places, this probably isn't too much of an issue, but there is a higher-than-normal chance that something will kill, either to eat you or just because.
8. Learn about Canadian history. I took a short course on Canadian history, but you can find a book or youtube channel and learn about how Canada was formed. Learn about the experience of Indigenous peoples. Understand the role women have played in forming Canada. Learn about black Canadians and the communities they've built. Learn about historical Canadian racism. 

Due to circumstances, I seriously considered moving back to the UK this year. At one point, I had actually decided to go. Making the decision actually made me realise how much I love Canada, and what opportunities it has provided me.

If you are thinking of moving here, I can't recommend it highly enough. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/14n98hl/emigrating_from_the_uk_canada_is_extremely_tough/,"As a UK expat myself I can say that I largely agree with what you noted, I moved to Nova Scotia in 2012 then to Toronto in 2021.

Can’t say I thought about returning to the UK but I came pretty close to having to because at the time my permit was close to expiring.

About Canadians not being like Americans there is a “yes” and “no” element to that - Canadians like the same sports, music and TV shows. Heck, we even have a very similar TV schedule to the American networks. There are also a few much older Canadians who like the monarchy because they relate to it for some reason, but that is as far as being like Brits goes.

Glad you love it here too!"

npfa94,Other,Marriage Fraud - How Long Does It Take IRCC To Investigate?,"Here Is My Story:

Our extended families have know each other for a very long time (20+years) and they introduced us to eachother. Everyone was very happy and supportive.

We talk over whatsapp for about 6 months before I went overseas and got married in 2019.

I came back to Canada and started the sponsorship process.

Because of covid delays, my wife arrived in Canada on Feb. 2021.

In March, she got her PR card. The following week while I was at work, she ran away.

Her mom (who lives in India), called my home and said that her uncle came and picked her up, and that we shouldn't try to contact her because she was ""stressed"". And that if anything happened to her, she would put us all in jail.

We didn't have any fight or argument leading up to this. Things were normal.

I always told her that if there was ever an issue, she could tell me and but she never said anything, ever.

I sent her a message to ask her if she was ok but she never replied or even looked at my message.

Looking back, there were a lot of red flags that I should have seen.

I remember asking her if she wanted to put her ids in the safe with mine but she didn't want to.

She always wanted to keep all of her ID's with her.

She would take calls in another room or upstairs, turn down the volume and talk quietly so I couldn't hear anything. If I entered a room, she would quickly end the call.

I never looked through her phone. I really wanted to trust her.

I know she came to another country and I wanted to give her space and make her feel as comfortable.

She asked about the PR card a lot.

The longer it took the more angry she seemed to be get at me.

I was fully invested with her. I thought that she was my partner for life. I helped her get her drivers license, bank account, credit card, and paid for driver training school. She didn't have to worry about any living expenses. 

After everything, I can't believe it was all just for a PR card. I'm extremely devastated. I never saw this coming, never thought that she was capable for doing something like this to me.

Her relatives In Canada are in disbelief, disgusted, and embarrassed by her actions. None of them want her in their home. They really want her to be deported as well.

I've heard that she ran from Ontario to Surrey, BC and that she has a friend there that works at a lawyer's office that's been advising her this whole time.

I filed a police report, they said that she was ok but didn't want me to know her wherabouts.

I reported it to IRCC as marriage fraud through CBSA's online portal.

I also paid an Immigration lawyer to prepare an affidavit which they sent to IRCC in April.

Anytime I tried to call IRCC it goes to CBSA, CBSA say they don't provide information.

This has caused more stress than I can explain. I've had to take weeks off work, meet Counsellers, lawyers, ...

She committed marriage fraud but it doesn't seem like anything is happening.

As her sponsor, the government holds me legally responsible for her but because of the Privacy laws, no one is telling me anything. This doesn't make any sense.

And even though she committed marriage fraud, I still have to go through the normal divorce process. Apparently fraud isn't a ground for an annulment.

I know its all my fault. I have no one to blame but myself. All i want is justice. The government to deport her so I can start rebuilding my life and move on.

Does anyone know how long it takes IRCC to investigate? And are they seriously not going to tell me anything even though Im the sponsor?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/npfa94/marriage_fraud_how_long_does_it_take_ircc_to/,"The process takes time and I believe it doesn’t always lead to deportation. None of this is your fault and blaming yourself will not do any good. I understand the desire for justice but your moving on shouldn’t be tied to her being penalized. It appears you’ve taken the legal steps to protect yourself but I suggest not losing sight of your well-being. Time is precious, don’t waste it on someone who doesn’t deserve it."
155csbt,Other,Thank people who are helping you on this sub.,"This sub is ridiculous sometimes. It’s 90% people who demand answers to immigration questions that have already been answered at some point over and over, and then complain or repost when they don’t get the answer they wanted to hear. The other 10% are people who selflessly and thoughtfully answer those questions.

There are a few troopers who keep posting answers here that are almost always factually correct and are giving the right advice which those who don’t know any better shrug off as an “opinion” and ignore. 

I don’t blame anyone who is tired of folks who seem so entitled to free advice when professions like licensed immigration consultants exist. Why is immigration somehow treated differently than a professional accountant who you pay to do your taxes? 

The folks on this sub answer your questions for free and in good faith and are rewarded with insults and petulant comments questioning the accuracy of the answer – even when links to official sources of information are provided (just because you don’t understand the wording of IRCC’s webpages doesn’t make it wrong).

Rant over; thank the 10%. And learn how to use the ""search"" bar.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/155csbt/thank_people_who_are_helping_you_on_this_sub/,"We help people because we genuinely want to help people on their immigration journey, not because we're expecting to get a 'thank you' from them (even though, of course, getting a 'thank you' when we spent our own free time answering a question and helping is nice, but it's not the main goal of the 10% of users who answer immigration questions here).

Yes, many people post questions that have been answered many, many, many times here, whose answers they could easily find simply by using the search bar at the top of this sub.

And yes, unfortunately sometimes people's posts and comments come off as rude, or with a sense of entitlement of expecting users here to spend their free time providing all the answers on a silver platter, with 0 effort from the person who asked the question(s), as if we were their personal, free lawyer or immigration consultant, when that's not the purpose of this subreddit.

The fact people are given *free* immigration advice here might also influence this sense of entitlement; some people equate something that is free with something that has low or no value, and so something they don't think warrants respect, hence why many lawyers and RCICs do paid consultations and refuse to do any free consultations; it's easier to take the legal advice and help being given seriously and value it more if the person seeking help spent money to get that advice and help.

And even though many people here provide factually correct information, and with a level of detail that lawyers and RCICs charge money to provide, the fact that we're providing that information and advice for free makes people not value it and react the way you described which of course is frustrating for the users who took time of their life''s to answer people's questions and help.

But we also need to understand that often people come here very stressed and worried, whether because their application is taking too long to be processed, or because they made a mistake on their application or another immigration issue they perceive as urgent, which sometimes translates in a tone when interacting with people here that, unfortunately, is not always polite.

But what do you suggest? We can't change the mood someone is in when they come here asking a question or what their behavior is when interacting with users here or make every single user here use the search bar before asking a question, and take the time to search if their question was asked and answered before."

tonxtb,Other,"Two year update.... Some good. Some bad. Unsure of the future, but optimistic.","  

I struggled for a year to write this, but I felt it was important to give an update on my first year (well, almost 2 years now) in Canada as a new PR.

TLDR Canada can be great place to live, but the cost of living is very prohibitive to newcomers. It can also be quite hard to get started, and many systems are not designed with the needs of immigrants in mind. In fact, many will push against you. Those coming from developing countries will be happiest with the economy and quality of life in the long run, while those coming from developed countries will probably have reasons other than economics for coming here. Life here is roughly on par with the other major developed nations. Canada can make a great starting point for young immigrants from developing countries, with its great passport, but I am unsure of the long-term outlook for Canada.

\--------------------------------------

Once you’re in, you kind of forget about this sub because you’re so busy organizing your new life. I’ve also felt very shy to express my feelings on being here as I still feel like I’m a guest in Canada, and do not wish to be insulting or rude. I hope this provides some insight to those of you who are still on your journey here, and maybe helps those who are already here feel a little less out of touch with others. Overall, my wife and I are happy here and recently had our first child (mini Canuk!). There are however some things which give me pause when thinking about the next 10 years, and our futures in Canada. 

For context, my wife and I are in our mid/late-30’s. I’m African and she’s European. English is my first language, she is fluent, and we both have masters’ degrees from the USA. We have lived/worked in Africa, Europe, Asia, and North America. We came in though the Federal EE stream in mid-2020 from the United States where we were immigrants too. In total, I was there for around 6 years. First as a migrant worker, then a grad student, and then a college level educator. I applied for Canadian EE as a backup plan, because I had doubts about my employer’s sincerity and competency surrounding the US PR process (aka green card).  I got the ITA the week that my mom passed away, and it was a very difficult 60 days to get everything in. Especially with traveling back to Africa, and grieving. 

We really liked the US, and the money, but we never felt like we wanted to have kids there. Despite the fact that we really wanted kids. My wife ran out of work authorization, so the last few years in the USA were tough for her mentally and for us financially. Near the end of my last US contract, I got confirmation that my employer didn’t follow through with Green Card assistance as promised. It’s not really feasible to apply without their backing. By that time Corona was in full swing and Trump was making a lot of noise about changing foreign employment law, so options were limited. It came down to going to another small US employer, and hope that they would follow through with a Green Card. This meant another 3-5 years waiting for that, during which most of that time my wife couldn’t work, and then another 5-7 years after that for citizenship. Again, if the next employer would follow through with PR assistance. I got the Canadian COPR about the same time as my US contact ended. Canada offered immediate PR upon landing, and citizenship in 3 short years. Quite appealing, especially considering that my current passport has me needing hard to get visas to visit developed countries.

We looked at Alberta and BC, largely because of us living in Washington State and Corona limiting travel options. Corona meant that we couldn’t visit any communities, except one for a soft landing right after we got the COPR and literally right before the border closed. Shipping our furniture would have been very expensive, and hiring a uHaul didn’t seem feasible because of the isolation restrictions. So we sold most everything packed 2 cars worth of stuff, stored another vehicle, and made the jump.

I have a cousin in Vancouver, and my wife has an aunt in NB. My cousin was initially thrilled we were coming, offered to have us do our quarantine in their Air BnB, and then introduce us to Canada. Sounded great until it came to cost, which was about 3 or 4 times the hotel cost we were looking at. We opted to just go straight to the town we’d chosen instead, and that was that pretty much. I reached out a few weeks later to try smooth things over, and came to find out they were in my town for work. They were “too busy to see me now but would be back many times for work, and would let me know next time”. I’ve heard nothing from them since. It really sucks because I know neither of us have much family here.  C’est la vie.

Our quarantine Air BnB had a nice private garden, and gave me a chance to power through the last few seasons of Trailer Park Boys. Wish I’d known about Letterkenny then…Only half kidding.  Apartment hunting was a little tough because we didn’t have a credit score. You may have read somewhere that offering 6-12 months of rent up front can help smooth things over…Yea, don’t do that. In my experience people found that offer to be quite questionable. In the end we got quite lucky because about the time we came out of quarantine, a lot of AirBnB’s and other types of accommodation were getting desperate for renters due to lockdowns and no one traveling. We had one really bad experience where a corporate rental agency denied renting to us after discovering we weren’t Canadians. They were silly enough to put that into writing, and Reddit helped me complain to the BC Human Rights commission. The agency settled with us, and we got a small payout. 

On our first outing to a lake recreation area, we came across a frantic mom who had locked herself out of the car. It felt pretty funny to be able to help her break into her own car, coming from a country with a high crime rate and learning about crime through trying to avoid it. 

We ended up in a really nice quad-plex, where the owner also lives. The owner had been advertising for months and didn’t have anyone even come and look, so we got a big discount on rent. 12 months later, the average rental price for a place like ours is double what we pay now. If you can even find a place at all, because now all the students are back and there is a huge housing shortage. However, we still pay more in rent now than we ever did in the USA. We have a good deal for the current situation, but it’s still a good chunk of our income.  

The first couple weeks are kind of a blur of trying to get squared away administratively. That was a mission in itself as BC and Canada sure do love their paperwork. Most BC systems are quite centralized, which is good and bad. The biggest issue I had was that no one knew what a COPR document was, which I needed to use as immigration ID while waiting for the PR card. We started the PR card process during our soft landing, and in total it took 5 months to print. The overlap was about 6 weeks, 2 of which we spent in quarantine, so I had to wait a month before I could apply for some things. The first few weeks were probably the most frustrating, as it’s a lot of running around getting documents in. Bank accounts, drivers’ licenses, phone plans, utilities, etc. The lack of a credit score and PR card made things very difficult.  We reached out to the local Immigration Services office, and they were pretty helpful. My wife volunteered with them in the beginning of our stay, and we made some good friends that way. They also helped us join a local hiking group, which has really been great. 

That summer (2020) was awesome for us, with BC being truly breathtaking in its natural beauty. Winter was great too, but you really need a winter activity you can enjoy outside. 

My wife got work in her field (social services) pretty quickly, which we expected. Seeing her happy face when she got the job offer, after her struggling to feel useful for so long, was just so great. She did have to start at very low down though, as no employers would validate her foreign experience. It’s by no means a dream job, but it’s a step in the right direction and she’s really enjoyed it. 

I’ve struggled a lot with work so far. I’ve applied for a bunch of things in my field, even some I felt I was as close to perfect a fit as you could get, but with really mixed results. Mostly you hear nothing back, some will interview then ghost you, and others might make a really low offer and want you to move.

I got a little consulting work from a friend in the US initially, and also decided to head back to school to do a 2yr degree. I chose to do it mainly because loan interest rates were low, and I needed to meet people. All the classes have been online, but I still met a lot of people that I later got to see in person. The program also helped me FINALLY land a job…. although in one of the most Northern communities and not in a field I’ve had much experience in. I’m exited to get started, and we’re in the throes of planning our move further north. 

It’s been a lonely 1.5 years, with little opportunity to socialize or engage with our community. Still, we’ve made some great friends. Although, almost all our friends are immigrants or minorities.  The past year has been kind of stable with my wife working, and me studying, doing some consulting, and a little part time work locally. The issue now is housing. We really want to own our own home, but housing prices are just insane.  We decided to start trying for a baby, and had our first child in December. Overall, our experience with BC Health was pretty good until yesterday. Knowing that all our care was covered by provincial insurance was pretty great too, and relived a lot of stress. The system can be frustrating at times, especially because it’s a governments system. However, like all of Canada’s systems…one you know how it works, things become easier. Not easy, just less hard. It just takes a while. 

Summer last year (2021) was awful, with a lot of fires and flooding in the region. It was a very hard summer for us, not being able to enjoy the outdoors. I took a break from applying for jobs for almost a year, then started again this year. I took some part time ranch hand work in the meantime. I had a few interviews, but again the same issues. Not enough Canadian experience, salary too low with a move and no benefits, move to an expensive area, etc.  When I wasn’t offered anything, I was always told how close I came. Very frustrating.  Then, out of the blue, I was offered a job through an instructor from my college classes. Doing something kinda related, but again would require a big move. Seeing housing prices skyrocket locally, and seeing some good opportunity to grow in the role, I accepted. My wife is on maternity leave, and there are a ton of jobs available for her in the community. Houses are also much more affordable, and we’re looking at buying now. We should move up in a few weeks, and are in the throes of planning all that. 

This week we had another quite negative experience, with a local doctor’s office. My wife went her entire pregnancy without being assigned a family doctor. Then, 2 months after my daughter was born, we get assigned one and set up for a ‘meet & greet’. However, we missed the appointment because it happened 3 hours earlier than we had scheduled with them. They changed the time of the original appointment, but failed to tell us about it. The secretary was really rude to my wife for “not bothering to show up on time” and “wasting the doctors time”, and got very defensive when we tried to explain that we had not been informed of the time change. I guess that is her job, and she “would never make a mistake like that”. Apparently, their policy is that if you miss the first meeting then you don’t have a family doctor anymore. You get dumped straight away.  The secretary did call us 2 weeks ago and left a voice message, which we still have, but she did not mention a time change. She only asks to confirm our 3 names for the appointment, and to call back if she has them wrong. She had our family names correct, so we didn’t call back. I tried to explain all this, but when told her I still had the voicemail I was told that I was being “really aggressive right now” and hung up on. Seeing my wife in tears broke me a little, and I admit I’m struggling to keep from feeling depressed. The silver lining is that we’re supposed to be moving soon, so couldn’t have kept that doctor long anyway. The interaction was still awful though, and representative of how you can sometimes find yourself mixed up in a system with no recourse. The doctor’s office made the mistake, chose to blame us, and that is just that.  This is one of the worst examples, but we’ve had a few experiences in a similar vein. It sometimes feels like people want you to fail here, and want to exclude you. It’s not always in words, but sometimes the way they look at and talk to you. We also saw this in the USA sometimes. 

It’s hard to complain because I still meet a lot of immigrants whose future status in Canada is unsure, and they have worse places they have come from than I have. I’ve met a few international students through my online program, and I’ve seen how brutally hard integration can be for those who look and sound more different than we are. We really like Canada, but we’re unsure of the long-term outlook. Our main concern is the cost of living, and our ability to own a home in an area we want to live in, while not being ‘house poor’. I also feel like the government is pivoting away from listening to voters, and I wonder about the long-term success of the middle class here. 

BC is also not representative of the whole country. We chose BC largely because of proximity, but strongly considered Alberta as well. We had plans to visit multiple communities before settling, but Covid changed all that. Ontario, for example, recently passed legislation which forces professional bodies to recognize foreign qualifications. BC has no such legislation. 

This week has been especially hard, with dealing with the family doctor situation. I sometimes wonder how others make it, when we have struggled so much and have so much experience being immigrants in other countries.  It’s been a difficult 2 years for everyone and I know that feelings are fleeting. I’m very excited for my new job which starts in a few weeks. The company has a mix of old & new Canadians, and is a non-profit that supports a field I’m passionate about. Everyone has been quite welcoming, and my boss is an old school Canadian cowboy who has been nothing but welcoming and supportive.   Fingers crossed I've finally found something good...

&#x200B;

The Bad:

· Canada is definitely a ‘nanny’ state and sometimes treats its citizens as such. Canadians also don’t like to really change much, until it’s well and truly broken, so many societal issues are getting worse;

· The centralized systems can be very frustrating, especially when you don’t fit right in. You often have no recourse with any issues, and a bad person behind a desk can be a show stopper. 

· The cost of living is really high, and salaries are much lower than the USA. Many Canadians blame immigrants for the rising costs of living. Taxes and car insurance are particularly high in BC. A new immigrant driver might pay $4500 in insurance a year for a single small car;

· Buying housing in any of the major or even smaller metros is out of reach for many Canadians and immigrants who do not have outside assistance. A possible deal breaker for us living here long term, like we originally planned;

· Renting is really expensive, and very hard for immigrants with no credit score;

· BC is really bad with needing provincial certification for many professions, and I’m shut out of some jobs unless I re-do my entire degree through a BC university;

· I’ve had a really tough time finding gainful employment in the fields that I was invited to live in Canada on. My income is a mish-mash of consulting in my field where I can find it, ranch hand work;

· It’s hard to make friends. Being friendly is one thing, but that often doesn’t translate into a friendship; Some will feign friendliness to learn more about you, to personally attack you better. 

· There seems to be little consequence for criminals, and there is sometimes more focus on ‘human rights’ than the rights of a victim to be safe. Kill someone while drunk driving? Maybe a year in jail. Break into a house or steal a car? No jail time. Murder someone? Well, you get a chance every few years to torture the victim’s family at early parole hearings.

&#x200B;

The Good:

· Stability through residency cannot be understated;

· My wife can work in her field again, and is happier than she has been in years;

· I can potentially work in any field;

· Lots of free services, like BC Health and the Human Rights commission;

· Canadians are friendly and Canada is generally quite safe;

· The outdoors awesome…when it’s not on fire or flooding;

· We’re happy and settled enough to have our first kid! Baby Canuk! 

· We will be citizens soon, and we can use that passport to go anywhere;

· I have more opportunity here as a PR than I did in the USA on a work visa;",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/tonxtb/two_year_update_some_good_some_bad_unsure_of_the/,"I'm a Canadian from BC. My husband is a Jamaican-American awaiting his PR decision. I've always found BC and Alberta friendlier than the east coast. Toronto people were rude and rushing everywhere. Montreal I actually cried while there because people were just nasty. Costs are high everywhere - BC has one of the lowest hydro rates in Canada though our gas prices take away that discount in a heartbeat and rent and housing costs are just plain robbery at this point.

Friends are hard to make due to covid even though restrictions are lifted now, and the older you get, the harder it just is overall (hubby is 40, I'm 34). 

Jail time varies, killing someone while driving drunk can earn a sentence **up to** 14 years (I think Canada is super lax on criminal repercussions tbh).  


Doctors suck here. No matter where you go... you will never be happy with the quality of healthcare. You'll get a doctor only to find they don't do a damn thing for you. 

If you work in healthcare you're basically guaranteed a job in Canada.

I think the federal government is more frustrating as I had to contact every different branch of it to change my name vs one contact to change my name for BC identification/healthcare.

The USA is better - until you need healthcare and can't afford it, or get shot by some wacko I guess."

- COVID information including vaccine proof must be uploaded in advance via ArriveCAN, and presumably available at the border too.
- Pre-arrival and on-arrival tests are still required.
- Suitable quarantine plan still required since the final decision on this exemption is made by the border official.
- No change for people with one dose of a two-sided vaccine series, unvaccinated travellers, those who completed their vaccine series less than 14 days ago, travellers with symptoms, or people whom the border official determines don't qualify for this exemption (i.e. one or more criteria not adequately satisfied)."

jt2uto,Other,Canada Announces Temporary & Permanent Resident Streams Specifically for Hong Kong Residents,"To summarize, three programs will be introduced specifically to Hong Kong residents:

1. Three-year open work permit for those who have graduated within the last five years from an eligible school. This sounds like it will be similar to a Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP), but without the restriction of the school being in Canada.

2. PR via graduation from an eligible Canadian school in the last three years.

3. PR via one year of skilled Canadian work experience in the last three year (this could be used in conjunction with 1.).

mtguqt,Other,"PR cards expire, but your PR status doesn't expire with a PR card's expiration date:","I wanted to post this for anybody who is worried that their permanent residency status ""expires."" I've seen many comments about it, and that is incorrect, it doesn't ""expire"":

Your permanent residency (PR) *card* is different than your PR *status*. Your PR *card* is like your passport, which is merely a document. Only citizens can have passports, and only permanent residents can have PR cards. Passports and PR cards have expiry dates on them (since they are documents), but your citizenship status doesn't automatically expire just because your passport does. When that happens, you remain a citizen, but your document is expired, so you need a new one if you ever need to prove your citizenship easily. Similarly, your PR status doesn't automatically expire just because your PR *card* expires. Your *card* is what expires.

Be careful, because you CAN lose your PR status, in a variety of very specific ways, like not spending enough days in Canada in a 5 year period. The details of that rule, and the other ways in which you can lose your PR *status* can be found on the [canada.ca](https://canada.ca) site. I've included a link below to that page which is titled ""Understand permanent resident status"".  So, if you don't want to lose your PR status, do NOT do anything that would lose your status. But, losing your PR *status* has nothing to do with the expiry date on your PR *card*.

Personally, I always want to have a current working passport and a current working PR card. Not having those documents would inhibit my ability to travel in an emergency if either of them expired. I also want to always be able to prove my citizenship status or my PR status easily in case of any other kind of unexpected emergency where I need to prove my status or prove my identity. The choice is yours if you want to keep a current working passport or a current working PR card that isn't expired. Just know that losing your PR status is not the same as the expiry date on a PR card.

To better explain about PR cards: You can be a permanent resident in Canada and not have a current PR card, just like you can be a citizen of a country and not have a current passport.  However, if you want to travel in certain ways, you need a passport, or you need a PR card, which are both travel documents and pieces of ID.  The document is *not* your status, the document merely *proves* your status, it shows your status, it states your status to authorities. The document can expire, and so you need a new one to be able to prove your status, but your status hasn't changed just because you don't have the document.   


So, just like you can renew passports when they expire (or before they expire) you can renew your PR card before it expires, or after it expires, providing you haven't somehow lost your permanent residency *status*.

hnavuc,Other,Canada opens doors to Asian tech talent fleeing Trump's US,,https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Canada-opens-doors-to-Asian-tech-talent-fleeing-Trump-s-US,"Cracking the code of landing a job in Canada is a very difficult one.

I worked as a high software manager for one of the FAANG company in the US. Good credentials, top class pedigree. I sensed things going from bad to worse in US and started applying for similar jobs in Canada.

Unfortunately (for good or bad) Canadian employers are generally not inclined to hire from outside. I may have responded to about 100 positions to land this job. But most did not want to hire non-Canadians. They would say that they do not want to sponsor work permit. This is also one of the reasons why Canada lags behind US in building successful companies. US employer would do anything for hiring top talent. Most Canadian employers would rather be slow in expanding instead of being proactive.

But credit goes to Canadian immigration system. Once you land a job where employer is willing to sponsor, things move fast. And you have fair visibility on when you can become a permanent resident. I have heard that even in these Covid times, work permit applications are getting approved in 2-3 weeks. And many PR applications are keeping pace too."

Now that I’ve achieved the goal, I’m feeling lost. I lost goals in life. I was working as an early childhood educator to achieve my goal mentioned above. And I always wanted to go back to the field where I worked in my own country once I became PR. I tried, I tried to find a job in the filed after becoming PR and it was just hard with lack of opportunity where I live in and other facts - maybe I wasn’t in the field for too long or my experience is from outside of Canada? While I was in the process of PR, I took online certificate courses offered in CA related to the field hoping it would help upgrade my resume and whatnot. I was only able to submit my resume to a handful of companies, as mentioned lack of job opportunity here, and didn’t even hear from any of those companies. Now I’m thinking like do I even like that field? Or is it simply because I have the job experience? Idk what I want to do. How can I get out of a rut, I need some help and advice.

Email to [IRCC.COVID-TravelExemptions-Exemptionsdevoyage-COVID.IRCC@cic.gc.ca](mailto:IRCC.COVID-TravelExemptions-Exemptionsdevoyage-COVID.IRCC@cic.gc.ca) was sent on **November 30** and we were approved on **December 8!**

email's body:

Name: (last, first)

DOB: (MM/DD/YYYY)

Citizenship: Your citizenship background

Current Residence: Your home address

Reason for Travel: I wrote a very short, two sentence long explanation about my desire to reunite with my fiancé including how long we have been apart from each other and our feelings about it and desire to reunite.

Dates of Travel: I wrote the dates I was thinking about and included two sentences about how these dates are tentative and negotiable. How I would love to stay for as long as I can but am open to necessary changes.

Quarantine Plan: I wrote two sentences here on my plan (personally, I will be with family friends who have a spare bedroom that is upstairs and generally away from the other family members). I would say it is important to make clear that you will self-isolate and that you will not need to leave for food or supplies (hopefully this is a possibility for you! but if not, I'm sure you could make a note about ordering your food or groceries through an app, etc. Making it as safe as possible).

Contents of Attachments:(here is where I attached the important documents and a few photos that i resized to meet their size attachment qualifications -- I can't remember exactly how big the email is allowed to be but I ended up resizing most of the files so they would all fit, using a resizing website on google).

hshv2d,Other,"Parents want to force my sister and I to move back to India, threatened us with documents","Hello, I'm writing this on my phone so the bear with me.

My family have been in Canada from 10 years and we're permanent residents. Recently, my parents (58m and 56f) have been threatening my sister (28f) and I (19f) that they'll force us to move back to our native country, India, because my sister refuses to marry someone they choose for her. It's a cultural thing so that's why. 

I know they can't really force us to do anything, I get that. However, my dad usually handles all the legal stuff for all of us. So now, my mom is saying that my dad won't renew our documents (like passports, PR cards, SIN cards) so that they can take us to India. 

I wanted to ask if that's possible? My sister and I have all of those documents with us. So, if we were to move out, could our parents hold that against us? Or can we just renew this stuff online ourselves even if we've never done it before? 

Also, do we really need the COPR papers and our birth certificates? Because I heard that we could apply to receive the COPR papers if we've ""lost"" them. We can't find them anywhere in our parents' possession and we can't exactly ask them for them.

Edit: we're Sikhs, if that makes any difference. I feel like Sikhs are very adamant about their children marrying someone in their religion and whatnot than maybe some other religions in India. Maybe I'm wrong! Just wondering though.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/hshv2d/parents_want_to_force_my_sister_and_i_to_move/,"1. They cannot force your sister to marry anyone.
2. You can renew your PR card and don't need them to.
3. You can live in Canada with an expired PR card no issue, so even if \*you\* forget to renew it, so long as you don't leave Canada, you're okay.
4. You may need your COPR and your birth certificate for citizenship applications.  You can apply for them to be replaced if you've lost them. The birth certificate would need to be replaced through the Indian embassy, and the COPR through Immigration Canada. You'd get a ""Verification of Status"" that would include details of when you landed. 

If your sister needs help, please either let me know how I can help her connect to an organization in her city that will help her, or I can give you some suggestions to pass to her."

kvh5zz,Other,Made it across the border to visit boyfriend with zero issues!,"Hello! I just wanted to share my experience coming across the border from the US with an exemption to reunite with extended family - in my case, my long distance boyfriend who lives in Victoria, BC. After reading many posts here on Reddit and scouring the Canadian government's websites about how to successfully prepare and plan to have a smooth experience coming in to Canada, I made a very diligent quarantine plan for the border officer to look at as well as printed many other documents such as proof of travel health insurance, my negative Covid test which was recently added, our notarized form, the emailed approval letter from the IRCC, our meal plan for the 14 day quarantine, etc etc. 

Because of all the reading I had done to prepare for what to expect, I thought I would have to spend a lot of time explaining my quarantine plan to the border officer and that I would be met with a lot of questions. Going through the border was a BREEZE. Unless I was just lucky and had the nicest, most chill border security officer in Calgary, this process was so much easier than I had anticipated and had stressed over for weeks. At my different airport stops, the one documentation besides my passport that I kept having to show was my negative Covid test. No one, not even the border security officer, asked for any sort of quarantine plan. I am glad I had one prepped in case but it was a surprise to me because it seemed like such a big deal to have a legitimate plan.

She asked for the approval letter that was emailed to me from IRCC, and asked where I was staying. I told her my boyfriend was picking me up from the airport and we were quarantining together and was prepared to show her my quarantine plan with specifics and contact info and addresses, etc. She never asked, she just said ""Perfect"", asked for my Covid test, and sent me on my way to my next gate for my connecting flight.

jqrizv,Other,IELTS Computer Based Vs CELPIP - A Comparison,"**Introduction:**

On several occasions, I have seen the question pop up on this subreddit: ""what test should I take for my PR?"". I have replied to such questions several times but have been unable to offer much insight for the IELTS computer based since I had never taken the test before. 

After taking the test earlier this week, I decided to make this post so that I could finally answer the question to the best of my abilities. Please keep in mind that I will be making this post based on my own experience, you may not have had the same experience and may disagree with me. This is only meant to be a reference for people looking into the topic. The experiences shared will be based on my most recent two sittings as those experiences are most fresh in my mind and I feel I can write about them more objectively.

I will try to make this as exhaustive as possible. Its a long post but divided into easily digestible sections so you can find exactly what you're looking for.

**My testing history:**

I took my first IELTS test (Academic) in 2016 for my study permit followed by my first CELPIP (RECBC) for an internship in 2018. I then took the IELTS General Training and CELPIP (IRCC) in November 2020. Why both? Well I wanted to take both the tests, see if I manage to score substantially better in one or the other and then use the better scores to apply for my PR as opposed to taking the same test over and over as some of my friends have.

My scores are as follow:

IELTS (Academic): L: 9, R: 9, W: 7, S: 8

CELPIP (RECBC): L: 12, R: 12, W: 12, S: 10

CELPIP (IRCC): L: 12, R: 12, W: 10, S: 10

IELTS (General Training): L: 9, R: 8.5, W: 8.5, S: 9

**Booking experience:**

My booking experience with CELPIP was very straightforward. I googled the test and the top result was their website. The information was readily available on the homepage and I was able to find centers close to me using a webtool that used my location to recommend centers. The price was clearly noted and once I initiated the purchase, the process was very straightforward.

IELTS however was slightly more challenging, for starters the fact that they're owned by British Council, IDP and Cambridge who all have their own websites and centers does not make the process easy for anyone, let alone someone who may not be a native english speaker. It took me a week to just figure out whether any of the websites were scams because the prices and centers listed on different websites were completely different from those noted on the others. Finding any means to contact their support was also very difficult because the website layouts are completely different for each.

**Prep materials:**

This is a category where I think both companies could really improve. The number of practice tests offered with your registration is dismal with ***one test when you register for IELTS*** and ***two for when you register for CELPIP***.

IELTS kept pushing me to buy their preparation package starting USD 50 by showing me the screencaps for more videos behind a paywall which felt like a very thinly veiled attempt at a money grab to me. CELPIP were more subdued with their efforts to get me to spend more money.

**Communication:**

Both IELTS and CELPIP sent me emails before the start of my test. IELTS sent them because my session was cancelled and I was moved to another session and nothing more. CELPIP sent me emails regarding free prep materials and reminders that my test was coming that I appreciated but I understand that might make some people anxious based on their disposition.

A major difference between the contact information provided to me for both was that CELPIP gave me the email and phone number for their head office whereas IELTS gave me the contact information for just my test center. I called CELPIP helpline with questions about my test venue and was connected to an agent on the first attempt after waiting around 3-4 minutes. They were very helpful and addressed my concerns. On the other hand I called the number IELTS provided me 5 times because I could not find the entrance to the test center and the call went to voice mail every time.

**Reaching the venues:**

I took my CELPIP test at Paragon's Vancouver Head Office. On the day of the test I reached the building and there were signs clearly telling me where I needed to go. Once inside the main building, the office was clearly marked and I was escorted in immediately.

As mentioned in the preceding paragraph, my experience with Eurocenters on West Hastings for IELTS wasn't that great. For starters, when I reached the building there were no signs to indicate that Eurocenters even operated there and there was no temporary signage that indicated where to go or what to do. I kept circling the building trying to find a way in to no avail, It was during this time that I was calling the number provided to me by IELTS and not connecting to anyone. Finally I noticed some one going into a closed door that I had previously seen leading to a construction site wearing an IELTS staff card. I stopped them and was informed that students are supposed to wait outside the closed doors until a staff member comes down to let students in every 15 minutes or so. This was not mentioned anywhere in the email I had received nor were there any signs stating so and despite arriving 20 minutes early, by the time I was let into the center, I was 10 minutes late.

**Facilities:**

Both the test centers were clean and well managed, quiet with adequate staff on hand who were helpful when needed. The major difference I noticed was in terms of the space and computer hardware for the test.

For CELPIP I was provided with about 3 to 3.5 feet of workstation space with a screen, headset, standard size mouse and a standard size keyboard. The workstation was separated from the others using a sound absorbent cork and fabric divider. My experience with the facilities was satisfactory.

For IELTS I was provided with just under 2 feet of space separated from others with cardboard and paperclips. The station came with a screen, headset, a standard size mouse and a small 9 inch keyboard. That keyboard destroyed the entire reason I was taking a computer based test. I work with computers all day and I type FAST but only on a standard size keyboard I found. My muscle memory has not been developed on a keyboard that is almost a third smaller than the standard and this completely wrecked my typing speed, caused tons of missed keystrokes and spelling errors. I especially felt it affected my writing portion. Whereas I was able to write and check a 500 word section one and 1000 word section over on the practice test with time to spare, I could barely muster 400 and 800 words respectively on the actual test with a quick glace towards the end to correct any spelling mistakes before the time ran out.

**The Tests themselves:**

The tests themselves were fairly similar in style, content and difficulty. The only major difference I could observe was in the speaking and reading sections and I feel that your preference for either test would probably be based on one or both of these units since the other two are almost identical.

*Speaking:*

Arguably one of the greatest difference between the test themselves is based on the speaking section. With IELTS offering face to face interaction with an examiner and CELPIP instead going for a fully computerized route where you answer directly into the microphone to given prompts. There are 3 speaking sections in IELTS for a total of 15 minutes and about 8 in CELPIP that last a combined total of about 45 minutes with about 30 seconds to prepare for each prompt and mostly a minute to answer them.

I don't think its easy to say if one is better than the other. The choice in this case rests heavily on what you're comfortable with. I personally, feel awkward talking to someone who I know is testing me so I prefer speaking directly into the mic instead but I have friends who say they find it easier to speak when they are directing their conversation at a person. So think about what works best for you.

*Reading:*

The difference for this section is not so much about content but more so about the fact that CELPIP lets you complete your section and move to the next at your own pace. Whereas IELTS requires that you sit for the full length of the section regardless of when you finish. This meant in my case that I was able to complete my CELPIP test about 50 minutes early and be on my way because I was able to finish my sections at my own pace.

For the IELTS however I had to wait for the sections to end. This wasn't a problem during the listening and writing sections where I almost took my full time but in reading since I had finished the section and rechecked it with 40 minutes still on the clock and then for 40 minutes I just.......sat there. Which is not great when you're in a testing environment as it made for a really stressful and long 40 minutes. I also felt that it affected my concentration and I had to get a cold start on my writing section.

**Conclusion**

The decision on which test to take will be influenced by various factors for you such as whether you are applying only for Canada or for several countries (in which case IELTS will be your only option), what tests are available in your area, whether you can find a booking and what kind of speaking test works best for you.

From a purely end user experience though, I feel that CELPIP offers a more straightforward customer journey and a more pleasant testing experience.

r6p5xt,Other,Is Canada all that it’s made up to be?,"Hi. I’ve been thinking of immigrating to Canada for a while now and I’ve been trying to learn as much as I can about the type of life I would have in Canada. Basically trying to make an informed decision.

So far I’ve heard a lot about how hard it is to make a living in places like Toronto and Vancouver, because of the expenses, but the people I’ve talked to make it seem like it’s so bad that it’s slowly becoming this dystopian place where almost everyone is poor or struggling, and they’ve said that it’s kind of spreading, slowly making everywhere in Canada more expensive and unaffordable. Is this true? If I move to Canada, am I going to be always worrying about money unless I have a high paying job? (I know that’s a hard question to answer cause there’s a lot of variables but I mean in general; think about a normal person with normal expenses)

Another thing I’ve heard is that it’s really hard to get a job as an immigrant unless the job is in things like fast food, or gardening, or taxi driving or things of that nature. Is this true? I mean, if I arrive with a bachelor degree and I’m qualified for a job in something more “high paying” will I struggle to get a job just because I’m an immigrant? (I also know that this one depends on the job but try to generalize it. Like, over all, would getting a job be hard because I’m an immigrant?)

I would really like to move to Toronto since I’ve lived my whole life near a big city and since I feel like there’s more chances for work in general but I’m really worried that if I do, I’ll never be economically stable and I’ll always be struggling to make ends meet. (Idk if I wrote that right. English is not my first language. Sorry for any typos) Am I worrying too much and fatalizing my future or should I expect my life in Toronto to be one where I always worry about money?

I’ve experienced NYC’s winters and as cold as they may be, they don’t bother me all that much. Are winters in places like Toronto similar or are they much worse?

Considering where Canada is atm, and where it might be headed, is immigrating a good choice or should I steer clear? I ask this because I’ve heard a lot of Canadians saying they want out and they want to move to the US or something.

Overall, I would love to be a Canadian citizen one day and be part of the great country that is Canada but I’m just worried of the type of life that awaits me there. I don’t want to suffer and be always worrying about money or some other issue that comes with living in Canada that I don’t know about. I hope my post is not offensive to anyone. I just want to know what I’m getting myself into. If there’s anything else I should know about Canada please let me know. (I don’t mean only bad stuff but also good stuff!)

Starting today, international students can work full-time and are not restricted to 20 hours per week. This only applies to:

- students who were *already allowed* to work off-campus.

- students who already *submitted* a study permit application as of **October 7**, assuming they are approved and are eligible to work off-campus.

In other words, if you applied for a study permit after October 7, the full-time allowance does not apply to you. Likewise, if you don't have authorization to work off-campus, you (obviously) cannot work full-time off-campus. 

Note that work experience gained while on a study permit cannot be used for CRS points in Express Entry i.e. the experience will not give you any points for having ""Canadian"" work experience to boost your score.

I’m not sure I really see the problem with that vast majority of these cases then, yes transportation does carry some additional risk during the pandemic but if there’s criminality/illegality involved, isn’t risk kind of an unavoidable part of making criminal choices? I also understand that CBSA personnel are facing added risk as well on escort duty, but that's kind of part of their job isn't it, just like EMS, firefighters, police or the military?

I would feel differently if we were talking about desperate refugees or something whose processing we could perhaps compassionately delay a few months through vaccination rollout...but that doesn’t appear to be what this article is talking about.

I'm trying to properly inform myself to what I'd be up against, should I decide to move.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/i423ax/europeans_who_settled_in_canada_what_do_you_not/,"Also from Poland, I moved to Canada a year ago. Prior to that I'd lived in Denmark and Iceland for couple of years.
First of all, I would never come back to Poland, maybe to Denmark if I really had to. 
Some downsides I noticed so far:
- Canada is full of immigrants but the immigration process (for me) is a real pain in the ass. Due to covid everything takes much longer than usual but even without that I find it outdated (no option to apply online for my type of PR), takes way too much time and requires insane amount of forms and documents. Moving within EU is a piece of cake (less work to do than to move between provinces here!) but even in Iceland (not an EU member) I needed a passport, a piece of paper and 5 minutes in the office to get residence.
- Food is worse and more expensive if you want to eat healthy. Produce especially, I had to change my diet significantly after moving here and focus on seasonal vegetables and fruit almost 100%. Alcohol is quite expensive too, same with eating out.
- Culture of tipping everyone, everywhere. I was used to give 15-20% tip in a restaurant where I was being served but here it's a minimum. They have those card machines that ask you if you want to give a tip everywhere: hairdresser, bakery, take out. Basically almost every time you use any service you need to expect to pay 20% more for it.
I am not even certain that employees get all this money. 
- Prices without taxes. That's something I'm slowly getting used to but I still find it annoying. 
- Travelling within Canada is very expensive, not easy and takes forever.
- Quebec is a strange part of Canada with laws that are always different than everywhere else.
- Provinces are almost like different countries within.one big country, they have different laws, rules. You need to change a health card, driving license, tons.of other things if you move. It's bizarre and unnecessary.

The biggest advantage for me is English (I don't speak Danish/Icelandic so it's a nice change), Canadians are very open minded and have lots of common sense as a nation, they are kind and even though people say that a lot of them are against immigrants I think it's mostly them not wanting more of them rather than having something against ones that are already here. I experienced a lot of mean comments, worse services in Denmark just because I was an immigrant, not a single time here. I love it here and this is first time I feel home.

Ps. I have experience living in Ottawa and Winnipeg. I used my phone so sorry for the typos."
16ujs5a,Other,Something is very wrong,"I don't really understand what is going on, but it seems deeper than COVID.

I have spent 100s of hours and \~15k of dollars to prepare my (economic) immigration application 3 years ago, when the processing stood at around 12 months. After 2.5 years with a lot of additional work and advisory I was finally able to get a PR confirmation (eCOPR).

I have promptly applied for a PR card, and it was stated that it would take around 36 days to arrive. 1.5 months later I'm seeing the time stands at 55 days.

During most of my PR waiting, I was assured that delays are COVID related, and that by the end of 2022 things will go back to normal (although as a newcomer I don't know what ""normal"" is around here).

As someone who has moved to half a dozen countries, I must admit that there is something deeply wrong with the way things are managed here. Never mind the inability to abide by standards met by at least 40 other countries, the lack of transparency is what really bakes the cake.

Didn’t get asked about a return date or have to prove I was going to leave the country at the end of my trip. Basically landed, went to a kiosk thing, answered the declarations, got a little slip with my picture on, showed it to a border agent who I’m pretty sure didn’t even open my passport just handed me a generic covid 19 leaflet and sent me on my way. Once I collected my bag they checked my deceleration again and I was selected for arrivals testing. 

Arrivals testing did seem to be any non-Canadian citizens arriving but that was just my impression. That was pretty seamless too. Registered with one person, got sent to a nurse who took my sample and told me it can take up to 5 days and then sent on my way. 

So if anyones travelling soon, the website makes it seem like there’s a good chance they won’t let you in due to covid but honestly all the worrying was for nothing so hope this puts some worried minds to rest.

I have been in the US for last 6.5 years on H1B visa. I graduated from top universities in India, have a Master's degree and am in a well paying job. However, to get a Green Card, the wait time in Employment based immigration categories for Indian born candidates is more than 100 years.  While the H1B visa system has been abused by many companies, I refuse to be stereotyped with the others and wouldn't want me to be considered as someone stealing American jobs; this despite the fact that companies must advertise and interview American candidates before hiring a foreign worker. 

I chose Canada as it recognizes my qualifications, let's my spouse work without any fear of political party changing the visa rules (Trump administration wanted to revoke EAD for spouses of those waiting for GC), equitable and accessible (but may not be better) health-care  and most importantly, I can be sure that my kids don't get shot at school.

ohm2c6,Other,Just landed in Toronto from Dubai. Figured will share my experience. Happy to answer any queries about it.,"Came in though work permit.

On landing, everyone is first directed to a self check kiosk where you have to scan your passport, answer few questions about your immigration status, and any covid symptoms. They take a picture of your face and print out a receipt which has your details and a picture. 

Took this receipt and handed it over to the border control officer. This is where they handle the quarantine check. She asked for my purpose of visit (work), vaccination card (am fully vaccinated, from US) , ArriveCan receipt number, if I have any symptoms or not. No quarantine plan or questions about where I would be staying etc was asked (I had a sublet agreement in hand in case they did). She took the receipt from the kiosk marked it and put a green sticker on my passport (green means no need to quarantine and no 8 day testing)

After this I went to the immigration officer who asked all the same documents, along with my work permit letter, asked questions about where I'm coming from, my work and how long I'll be staying etc, took fingerprints, gave me my work permit and marked the kiosk receipt again.

Then, came the arrival testing.  Long queue. You have to register with Switch health for the testing, (would recommend to register before hand as the line was shorter for that as opposed to people registering on the spot) I had registered before my departure flight, so they retrieved my account from the system (which has my contact info),and handed me the covid testing kit.

I then handed the kit over to the covid testers, who take a nasal swab (thankfully not a deep swab) and then I'm free to go.

On the way out, if your passport doesn't have the green sticker, you are given a home covid testing kit to be used on day 8.  Since I had the green sticker, didnt need to. 

Then on the way out the terminal you hand over the kiosk receipt to another officer, waiting near the exit.

u3wqcs,Other,Scam Alert Please Read It," 

I have been in Canada for 6 years and very well aware of scams and all schemes but for some reason this one almost got me still. So I want to make other people aware. 

I get this call from a phone number, I had not answered the first time I received that call, then I get the call again so, I google that number and then I find out that its an actual phone number from IRCC. So I went ahead and picked up the call. They knew my name and all, nothing very sensitive. This person tells me that my SIN has been compromised, and has been used to commit identity fraud. Bank accounts have been made and money has been laundered using my SIN. The person did not have an accent, (usually I would hear the accent and it gives away that its a scam) and was very much a native english speaker. While I am on the phone with this IRCC pretending scammer I get another unkonwn callers phone call and I didnt pickup, my phone was on speaker (he heard the beep beeps that you get or he just knew beacuse it was their scheme that I was getting a phone call) so i go ahead and search this phone number online and this was an actual police station’s phone number. I let him know that I think it was the police, and then he goes I should take that call and he will hold while I am on the call. Now the person pretending to be the cop, tells me that he has a warrant against me and they have put the warrant on “hold for now” and then he tells me I have one hour to get a cousel/lawyer if I need one and thats the end of the call with the pretend cop. And then I tell this to the IRCC scammer, he tells me, you do not really need a counsel/lawyer since they have all the evidence that, It is not you who committed the laundering (trying to get to make you believe they are real and they can help me) so, after that they tell me that they will be contacting the corresponding police station right now and get this figured out. And after 5 mins they tell me that looks like you will need a counsel in your case (while also telling me that usually you do not require a counsel in such cases because IRCC can deal with it, but this time around in this case you will need a counsel). The IRCC scammer also asks me to navigate to the IRCC legit website and shows me parts about arrests, detention and deportation. And then the IRCC scammer goes, it sounds to me that you are not quite understanding the depth of this situation, seems to him that I am not able to understand what’s happening, and offers to have a translator. (Even though I am very fluent in English and would just rate myself just as good as any other native English speaker, I told him yes I would like a translator in the language Gujarati which is quite honestly a selective language than Hindi which is less spoken then Hindi. And the IRCC scammer goes, hold on while we arrange the translator for you, a minute goes by and then the IRCC scammer goes that now I will put the officer who can speak Gujarati on line (now the gujarati speaking IRCC scammer explains everything to me again in Gujarati). He had an accent in Gujarati, meaning that he didn’t sound a native gujarati speaker and a native english speaker. So this tells me then that it must be a Canadian raised officer who has Gujarati decent and can speak that language. (And the fact that they actually were able to get a translator for me reassured me that this cant be a scammer, since they even have a translator.) And after that he tells me that I need to pay for the counsel that IRCC will appoint me, I am like okay whatever to get my name off of a warrant. He tells me I will have to go to a bank and withdraw cash and go deposit it into a “BAIL DEPOSIT MACHINE”. I am very much familiar with my city and all the millennial trends and all. This “BAIL DEPOSIT MACHINE was at an address where a bitcoin machine is and I knew that (thats when the alarms went off in my head that this is a freaking scam). They very much had me until the payment part. 

I dont know if anyone has made post like this but I want to reiterate it anyways since I dont want anyone to be prey to a scam like this.

&#x200B;

1. They do not let you think and gets you frustrated, so that you cant think straight
2. They make up such statements that lead you to believe that you should not disclose this to anyone
3. They keep you on the phone so that they know what you are doing at every point in time by saying that (this conversation will be used as an evidence if need be)

Things I learnt:

&#x200B;

1. If police had a warrant against you, instead of warning the culprit, they would rather just show up at your door step 
2. Cops would always call you from a private number
3. Even thought the number that we see on the phone are real the person talking to you may not be.
4. If you call back on the phone number the call will actually go to the legit corresponding organization (in my case IRCC and police station). Basically they can hide their real phone numbers and show caller IDs of an actual organizations.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/u3wqcs/scam_alert_please_read_it/,"This is very common, I get these calls soso often.

ihhutb,Other,FYI: SIN Number Applications for Newcomers to Canada,"
Just thought I’d leave this information here just Incase anyone comes across the same situation as me or has similar questions so they wouldn’t have to spend hours in queue to speak to a Service Canada agent: 

1. You can apply/renew your SIN number online. But different from the regular application in person, online applications need to have proof of address. I know this is difficult for people who have just moved to Canada and due to quarantine can’t physically go open a bank account/phone number etc. To fix this, you could always change the address of your bank accounts back home to your Canadian address (or a friend’s if you don’t have one yet) and ask them to print out/send you a statement (or e-Statement) with the new address and use that for your proof of address. 

2. You ARE allowed to work even if your SIN application has not yet been approved AS LONG AS you have submitted the application already (even if you are renewing/changing status). It takes 20-25 days for SINs to get approved now and it’s hard to delay work for that long. I called Service Canada to verify this information as I myself was scared I would be working illegally. 

Maybe this was something everyone knows already but hope it helped!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/ihhutb/fyi_sin_number_applications_for_newcomers_to/,"You can apply for it at the airport (YYZ) too and they give it to you immediately.

wxsk5x,Other,IRCC releases detailed inventory and backlog information,"News release [here](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2022/08/tackling-immigration-backlogs-to-help-canadian-businesses-grow.html).

Inventory and backlog tracker and information [here](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/stronger-immigration-system.html).

IRCC has released detailed information about IRCC's backlogs and inventories, including projections, divided into types of application (e.g. study and work permits, skilled worker permanent residency, citizenship, etc.).

Someone else may take the effort to analyze the data, but it seems a bit like IRCC is both trying to justify to those waiting for their applications to process by explaining how much work they're dealing with while simultaneously also patting themselves on the back with how many applications they have processed. I get that accepting ever-higher numbers of applicants is something to be proud of, but at the cost of consistently not reaching its own service standards seems a bit tone deaf imo.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/wxsk5x/ircc_releases_detailed_inventory_and_backlog/,"It gives good insight sure, but i was hoping to see a more personalized status bar.  Like within my own application, on my account. Like i have nooo idea if my application is in backlogg or processing, and where it is in the processing stage. I wonder how much resources and time it took them to make this data page, as opposed to actually processing. 

Guess its still better than getting no reply from ircc and no transparency. Better than being fully in the dark i guess. They state their reasons for their delays, and additionally their solutions. I always love seeing visualized data regardless, very informative! But sadly, this doesnt do much to easy my anxieties 😔"

mz4kk4,Other,"Bit of a rant, arrived in Canada but getting settled/admin sorted, what an ordeal...","My wife and I landed in Canada on 16 Apr, here on my work permit. Currently doing our self-isolation period.  Trying to get ""settled,"" but oh my god, they don't make things easy.  The main things I'm trying to get are:

SIN number, bank account, Canadian phone number.

1) Trying the online SIN application, document upload thing doesn't work. Get some random error when uploading my work permit ""sequence contains no elements"", whatever that means. Even if it worked, it says you should wait up to 25 business days to get it. SIN also requires Proof of Address, but of course I don't have any utilities/bills yet. I have a rental lease agreement, but I'm not living there yet (using an airbnb to finish self isolation, rental starts next month). I've requested an in-person appointment, so hopefully I get this, soonish as well. Just hope they don't mind calling me on my international number (roaming is costing me quite a bit...).  Also, don't get me started on the rental agency requirements and requests...

2) Bank says I need a SIN number to open a bank account.  But I can't get a SIN in person, and the online application is not working/takes long. I found this a bit surprising, Australian equivalent of a SIN is a TFN (kind of, from what I gather). Do not need a TFN to open a bank account (do still need one for tax returns etc, but can get a bank account started without).  

3) A lot of online services need a Canadian phone number and/or Canadian bank card to use. That's very difficult and painful when you just landed and are doing self-isolation. Can't even get a friend to buy a pre-paid sim and get it delivered to me because it insists that shipping and billing address are the same.

I've relocated between countries twice before this, and this is by far the most tedious experience I've had. I know Covid doesn't help, but they really don't help make things smoother.  So many requirements seem circular and no provisions are made for people who have just arrived. 

Is it just me who thinks this or is Canadian bureaucracy and red-tape known for being this painful?  Any tips or ideas that I have missed or not considered to help get things sorted? 

Sorry for the rant.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/mz4kk4/bit_of_a_rant_arrived_in_canada_but_getting/,"We're going through this, as well, though we're a few weeks ahead of you.

Canada is very attractive to me, because of language, culture and weather. However, I am in, let’s say more prestigious job with really good income (in local terms).

It might get tough with culture shock, lack of friends, timezone differences between you and your old contacts and family, seasonal depression, etc., but sticking to a mentality of always moving forward rather than staying stagnant is key to improving your life here.

The thing is, the housing crisis might discourage me from staying here for the long run. I'm personally looking to move to at least 3 more countries in my lifetime.

I did not see too much information regarding this when I was searching so hopefully I can help someone else out who is looking. 

Landed in Toronto, went to immigration, and was over and done with within 10 minutes from getting off the plane. Filled in a form to give my number, email plus an address for where I was staying during my quarantine. Picked up my suitcase, got the bus, and coach to where I was staying. 

No phone calls during quarantine, I did receive two generic emails. I was checked up on by the police at around 8 pm one evening. She seemed more confused than me why she was there but was perfectly nice. Other than that I had no contact.

My PR card arrived 3 weeks after landing.

xxmarr,Other,News Updates from Unofficial Sources,"In light of the recent letdown that a new TR to PR program was ""expected to open"" last month because of *speculation* made by private immigration companies, I thought it might be good for any potential immigration applicants to know that private immigration companies are not official sources of immigration news.

News about new immigration programs or policies should only be followed in official IRCC sources, such as the [Newsroom](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news.html) and [Notices](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/notices.html). Anything published by a private company that has no affiliation with IRCC is literally hearsay and should not be treated as ""fact"", as tempting as that may be.

Which place is better to move to? Anyone in a similar situation?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/nszgi2/canada_or_usa/,"FWIW, from one random Redditor's opinion:

The immigration/sponsorship process for your wife to get permanent residence in Canada is likely A LOT easier than it would be for you to get a Green Card in the US. The process can be done without attorneys in most cases in Canada. I don't think anyone would say the same for the US.

I'm a dual US/CA citizen and have lived in both countries, but much longer in the US. The differences between the US and CA are sometimes subtle to see, but they are definitely there.  Canada absolutely has a better work/life balance than the US. The public school system, on average, is better in Canada if you plan to have kids. (People in the US make decisions on where they live based on schools, people looked at us kind of funny here when we asked about that.) US politics is really broken and getting worse. It's pretty unsettling. The social safety net in the US is very bad. I've, fortunately, never needed it in either country. But if I happened to get sick or injured in any serious way, I'd much rather be in Canada.

I'm living in Canada now and have no plans to ever move back to the US."

According to my lawyer the application was rejected and sitting in their mail room- apparently it was just returned according to them. After almost an entire 12 months. 

We only ever got a temporary application number with our application - I followed up with immigration, our lawyers and our MP- everyone said it was because of delays but I thought it was weird we never got the AOR.


Reason the entire application was returned:
My lawyer missed printing their name on the use of representative form



My partner and I are absolutely heart broken right now. A new application was resubmitted. Being cooped up at home and her not being able to go back home to visit her family for a very long time has seriously impacted her mental health. 

We hired a very well known law firm in Ontario. They initially assured me everything was perfect- they had their senior lawyer review the application as well as 2 others in the office before it was sent off.
