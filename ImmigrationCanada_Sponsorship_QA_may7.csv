"I'm the PA, sponsored by my Canadian husband, an outland application. I'm a US citizen.

I got my PPR at the end of April and within a few days I had sent them everything they needed, EXCEPT an envelope in which to send me my CoPR...

I'm wondering two things: 1) Is it possible they'll have mercy on me and just grab a plain envelope to send my stuff back in? I sent them a return label for UPS, and I'd think they can just send the documents in any old envelope... and 2) How long will it take them to notify me if they will require me to send the things again?

I'm grinding my teeth over here trying to figure out how to be proactive in this situation. Should I submit a case-specific inquiry? Should I try to call somewhere? **Will my whole application be denied if it takes longer than 30 days (the required PPR turnaround time) to hear back from them?**

Last thing: I'm wondering about tracking. I login to the mycic dashboard to see my application status. I haven't been able to login the other way, the ircc-tracker. It won't let me make an account. Can you see your CoPR number appear on the mycic application dashboard, or just on that tracker site?... I figure if I saw a CoPR number appear, I'd know they weren't going to make me send my PPR stuff again...

**THANK YOU FOR YOUR THOUGHTS!**",I didn’t not read the full thing but from what I could gather you forgot to pack in a return envelope with stamps or w/e right? In my opinion they will just mail it via regular mail to the address they have on file. I believe it will take longer for your mail to reach back to you ..,1304,283

Does this mean the spouse can not work for 3 years even though they’re a permanent resident? - or is it just making sure you’re taking care of them?","They can work but if they lose their job you’re responsible for ensuring their needs are met.

"Hi ! Any help/ advice would be appreciated.. So my common law partner is a Canadian citizen and we have been together for 4 years now, living in Jamaica (he has dual citizenship). We’ve been discussing moving to Canada to settle down and wanted to apply for spousal sponsorship. Initially we decided to apply for Outland sponsorship since we both live in Jamaica full time. However, he came to Canada for work purposes recently and I got approved for my visitor visa and have been staying with him in Canada for a few weeks now. 

I just wanted to know if being here as a visitor and staying with him counts as “living with a common law spouse in Canada” and would make us eligible for the inland sponsorship class (in addition to us having lived in Jamaica as a couple for more than a year and having other proof of our relationship). OR is the inland sponsorship class only specific to common law couples who have rented IN CANADA and lived together in Canada for at least one year . 


I hope I’ve worded this in a way that’s easy to understand, we are considering going to an immigration lawyer at some point but I figured there’s no harm in asking here for other peoples experience !","If you are currently living in Canada and are already common-law, you can apply as inland. 

A requirement of inland is that you be living in Canada with your partner for the duration of processing, so if his work in Canada is only temporary, outland might be a better option for you, as you could move back without risking the application.",1188,340
"Hi everyone, i am a Canadian citizen who lives in Quebec. I tried to sponsor my parents but i got rejected because i didn’t get enough income according to the Quebec’s rules.

I am planning to move to Fredericton mostly for school but i am thinking about living there for good and try to sponsor my parents again.

Does anyone had this experience, if so how did you manage?

Edit: for those asking about the revenue part, lets say it’s not a big concern. I will still be working in Fredericton on the same salary. What i am concerned about is if Fredericton is a good choice not just for the quality of life but also for the sponsorship process.

Edit: thanks everybody for your insights. What i can add is that i have a main job, it’s stable. Since it’s a work from home job, i can move easily. The second job is part time, mostly during the weekends and the shift varies every weeks. As i mention i am going back to school for a year to hopefully get a promotion, so the salary will definitely be better after that.",">...i am thinking about living there for good and try to sponsor my parents again.

"I am Canadian born citizen, sponsoring a wife in the Philippines. I'm visiting her in the Philippines and we are filling in the forms.  In the IRCC website under ""immigrate"", under ""family sponsorship"", under ""as a spouse"", under ""check if you're eligible"" is this...

>The sponsorship agreement means that:  
>  
>\* you’ll provide for the basic needs of your sponsored family members  
>  
>\* the person you sponsor will make every effort to support themselves and their family members

This seems to suggest that my wife should intend to be employed in Canada.  Searching for a similar phrase in IMM 5289 ""the guide"" seems to find no match. For example, I searched the phrase ""make every effort"". 

My wife does want to be employed in Canada and we both think it is a good idea. However, I am wondering why that is missing from IMM 5289.  Perhaps my interpretation is wrong.  Does ""make every effort to support"" exclude what economists might call ""at-home non-market production""?  In other words, suppose I estimate that it is more optimal for our total family income if my wife supports me by being at home to run the household while I have employment outside the home.  Is that situation precluded by this requirement for my wife to ""make every effort to support themselves and their family""?","There is no requirement that your wife work. The undertaking that you sign makes you financially responsible for repaying any government assistance that your wife might take in the three years after receiving her PR. With that context, I believe the form is trying to say that the applicant should make every effort to support themselves before relying on government assistance. 

But regardless of what exactly they were trying to convey: there's no requirement that she work, no.",1298,481
"Hi

Just received an update on my wife's application status. We now have 'medical exam', 'biometrics', 'eligibility' and 'background check' all listed as completed. Any idea what comes next?","If you haven't already you will likely receive sponsor approval soon. 

If everything is listed as complete and you have not received any additional document requests, this is a good sign that the PR will be approved. 

The next step will generally be approval and passport request. But, as with everything in this process, there is no set timeline for these things. Approval/PPR could come within a few days, or you may still wait a couple months with no communication. There's no way to predict.

"Hi, 

I need some help with providing the ""Criminal background"" check for the online application. Currently, my spouse is living in hong kong and I've reached out to the Hong Kong Police headquarters by email and they provided me with answers and a checklist to go through. 

In the checklist, there is a section that mentioned the following,   
===  
The ORIGINAL and a PHOTOCOPY (for each applicant) of a request letter from the relevant Consulate / Immigration Authority / Government Authority, which contains the applicant’s name and clearly indicates that the production of the Certificate is required.

There should also be a POSTAL ADDRESS of the relevant Consulate / Immigration Authority / Government Authority since the application result will be directly sent to them by registered mail.

If only the electronic copy of the request letter is available, please print it out for submission.  
===

So I called the Immigration Department in Canada about this and they provided me with a form, ""Request for Police Certificates/Clearances and Authorization for Release of Information"". I provided the sample to the Hong Kong Police headquarters however they said the form is NOT acceptable and mentioned the following, 

===  
Please understand that a request letter issued from a relevant Consulate / Immigration Authority / Government Authority to support the purpose of application is our fundamental requirement.  The letter shall contain the applicant’s name and clearly indicates that the production of the Certificate is required. There should also be a POSTAL ADDRESS of the relevant Consulate / Immigration Authority / Government Authority since the application result will be directly sent to them by registered mail.

You'd need to submit your PR application first, and in it, include a letter of explanation on how you'd need to wait for IRCC to send you a letter requesting your Hong Kong police certificate first, before you can apply for it; you can also include a print out of the above link, from the website, explaining this, on your PR application.

While your application would be in process, IRCC would send you a letter specifically requesting you to provide the No Criminal Certificate from Hong Kong.

With that request letter from IRCC you can then apply for that No Criminal Certificate. But you'd need to submit your PR application first; as mentioned on the website, IRCC sends that letter only after the PR application was submitted.",1868,1064

"Hi there. I would like to ask your opinion.

I am visitor status in canada and am now preparing to apply for PR application through spousal sponsorship in Canada. I am an applicant.  I don’t wanna make any mistake but I realized many mistakes in the past applications for the visa. I am so annoyed with myself. Please help me out..

About work history.

1. I filled form in the previous visa application that I’m employed by XXX (Canadian company) from Nov 2020 to Nov 2021. But actual timeline in the duration was below. 

\- November 2020 - April 2021 = Worked in XXX(Canadian company)

\- May to September 2021 = Went back to my country due to family thing

(I did a part-time job from July to August 2021 in my country)

\- September to November 2021 = XXX(went back to the Canadian company)

The question was just asking employment detail in the last visa application and I did not include   
 the stay in my country and the part time job info which was very short term and i don't even have official employment letter. So I simply filled just canadian company and employment duration from Nov 2020 to Nov 2021. 

Now the form is asking job related activities (employed, unemployed etc). So I am thinking to fill out without the part-time job info. Is this a big problem?

2. Also in work history, I filled a wrong starting month of employment in my first to previous applications for visas(study, worker, visitor).

So, one of my work history was started from September 2012 and ended in July 2019. However, I filled April 2012 for the started month of employment every time when I applied for visa. I realized mistake this time and now I am fucked up. I am not asked to submit employment letter this time but.. I should fill out honestly.. what can I do in this situation. Should I correct and make explanation letter? 

I really made a lot of mistake.. Should I correct and explain about all the mistakes that I made in the past?

I appreciate if you can give me any advice or opinion. Thanks.","In this case, I would consulate an immigration lawyer.

"A close friend of mine with PR travelled back to her home country to get married as soon as she graduated university. Came back to Canada, and she finds out she is pregnant the day after she lands.

Her husband isn’t Canadian and he has only ever been to the US for university. 

She is staying with us right now- was supposed to just stay with us until she finds a place to rent and a job, but now that she’s pregnant I don’t think it’s wise for her to live alone or with random roommates. She is still looking for a job, as she needs one to start her spousal sponsorship application and to be eligible for mat leave

if we can’t find a way for her husband (or mom) to come here for her delivery and first several months of baby’s life, then I will have her stay with us long term, but we don’t have very much space in our home.

"Hi there. 
I need some advice about below..
Please help me.

I’m now trying to apply for PR application through spousal sponsorship. My status is temporary residence in Canada and I am an applicant. 

In order to apply for pr,  I got birth certificate recently. And I found out a problem.

In previous few visa applications, I was not aware of the mistakes which I wrongly filled city of birth. Country of birth was correct but I kept filling wrong city of birth. 

I filled city X which was where I was raised in the form and now after I got birth certificate, I realized I should’ve filled up the city Y which was where I was born.. (I was born in City Y but residence was in City X since I was born) .

"As the title says, If I could apply for the OINP (Ph.D. stream) or through my Canadian spouse for PR, which route would be better and faster and why?","This is really a personal decision. The standard processing for a spousal sponsorship is officially 80% of applications completed in 12 months. While many people have been seeing much quicker turnarounds recently, there are still many who are waiting the full 12 months or longer. 

PNP + Express Entry tends to have shorter processing, though again, processing times are very individual. Some people see quick turnarounds, others don't. 

A benefit of the spousal sponsorship is that you can submit your application as soon as you've filled it out. Unlike PNP + EE where you'll need to submit an EOI and then wait for an ITA (and eventually wait for an ITA after receiving the nomination) there's no wait period. 

So, in theory, a spousal sponsorship - despite having a longer official processing time - might be faster in the long run because there's no wait time, you can just submit right away. I'm not as familiar with the PhD graduate stream or its processing, but if that has the chance of an ITA right away, then this consideration might be moot.

Of course, the types of documents required for both streams are very different and you may find one much more straightforward than the other.

Edit: See below, the PhD stream is not EE, it's a paper stream, which do tend to see longer processing as well. I was unaware and that's my bad.",149,1344
"Hi Folks!

Just wondering how much I should be panicking, I searched the megathread for wait times, but I didn't see a similar experience.

"I'm helping a friend try and figure out the most straightforward plan. He is dating a lady in the Dominican Republic and they would like to get married. He is Canadian and lives in Canada.

Where should they get married? Does it matter? Will it affect the immigration process either way?

From what I can find, it looks like she could come to Canada on a visitor visa, they could get married, and then he could apply for spousal sponsorship for her. Potentially after that application is received, she could apply for a work permit. 

Is there any reason that getting married in the DR would make things easier or smoother?

"Hey hope everyone is good, long story short my wife is Canadian & we applied for pr residency in 2021, everything went well. In 2022 January my passport that I originally submitted was expired however I already had made new passport in November 2021, Ircc asked me to upload the new passport in March 2022 which I did but after a month I saw the website had bugged and it was uploaded but not submitted and the deadline had been passed, then we didn't hear from ircc until yesterday. Yes after 13 months, the visa was ready to be stamped on old passport but it was expired and the visa was supposed to expire in October 2022 but they simply didn't put the visa on the new passport that I had uploaded on their website. Now you might wonder how I know all this, so we put In a request and mailed ircc to give us complete history on our application so they sent us a 22 page long pdf which contained all this detail, the application was approved but in ircc website it still says decision pending and they don't know answer mails. What should I do? I need to reapply or is there a way to get the visa stamped as it was supposed to be, reapplying is something I can't do at this time. Does anyone ever had a similar situation, any info would suffice. Thank you guys","COPR are usually valid for 1 year after it's issued (date is tied to medical exam). You say it expired on October 2022 which is about 6 months ago.

IRCC *might* have send you an e-mail during that time, requesting a new medical exam, since yours had expired.

If you did not hear anything from IRCC, since then, your case is most likely closed. This means that yes, you need to re-apply.

But again, you would need to verify whether or not your case is closed. There is currently a strike, contacting IRCC by phone is nearly impossible. You can try reach out to them via web form, but expect a delay here as well.

I read on the IRCC website that VAC offices outside of Canada are working as usual. So are outland spousal sponsorship applications being affected? Or inland applications only?,"VAC offices do not conduct any processing.

VAC offices are local branches in other countries which allow you to submit applications, conduct biometrics etc.

"Hello friends,

I am currently in a complicated situation, and I can use some help. I am a Canada PR and I applied to sponsor my wife, who works in the US, in July 2022. After that, she actively started job hunting in Canada and signed an offer in December 2022. Her new employer filed for her work visa in March 2023. The situation now is that we have received the passport request letters for both work visa and PR together now. We have already sent in the passport for work visa stamping, which is when we received the passport request for PR. The thing is- we have already planned her move from US to Canada on the work visa. We were thinking whether it would be okay if she lands in Canada on the work visa, and we would then submit her passport for the PR. But we have a few questions before going ahead with this plan:

1. If she has been approved for both work visa and PR, would it cause any problems during the landing process? We plan on performing the landing process only on the work visa.

2. The passport request for PR stated that we need to submit our passport within 30 days of the passport request letter. Now, if there is delay beyond 30 days, what are the implications? Though we will attempt to submit the passport in Canada within 30 days, we might face some delays in the moving process.

2. What are the implications of submitting the passport for PR stamping from within Canada as opposed to submitting it in the USA? We would not need the single-entry visa for entering Canada.

Would appreciate any inputs, and thank you in advance.","When a PR is approved and COPR is issued, all temporary permits (work, study) gets cancelled by IRCC, including applications as well. So by the time she lands, it will be impossible to have both active work permit and PR.",1560,221
"Hi guys, 
I’ve noticed a lot of applications have reached the point where their eligibility & background verification status has been changed.

Or will they not conduct the checks untill we have given them all the information they requested for in the PFL?

"I am currently unmarried with a boyfriend in my home country. He is a seafarer, but I'm not sure yet what are the opportunities for cargo ship officers like him here in Canada. Considering I'm from Asian country, I'm guessing Canada have higher standards to be a cargo ship officer here too.

"Hello,

I was wondering if it is possible to sponsor my disabled wife into Canada. She recieves disability benefits in her home country (in which she will no longer be eligiable for once she arrives)

I have savings and income to support her, but I am curious if her mental disorders (depression and anxiety) and the fact she recieves Disability Welfare will effect her application in any way?

There is a big chance she will get better and join the workforce again, but in the event of that not happening: Would she ever be able to claim disability benefits from Canada after sponsorship period?


Thanks!","I’d talk to a lawyer given the complications in your application, but yes, you should be able to sponsor them. Medical inadmissibility due to excessive demand does not apply to sponsored spouses. In general, there isn’t a minimum income to sponsor a spouse. However, the officer reviewing your application can still find your spouse financially inadmissible if they think you don’t have a viable plan to support your spouse, or they may need to rely on social assistance. If your financial situation is as stable as you say it is, that shouldn’t be an issue.

Assuming all goes well and your spouse is admitted, the main place you will run into trouble is the sponsorship undertaking itself. For the first three years your spouse is in Canada, you’ll be footing the bill for any social assistance your spouse made use of. They can still apply for and use the programs, receive financial benefits etc., but it’ll become a debt that you have to pay. After three years, the undertaking is over, and they can use welfare programs without issue.",606,1040
So how do most people do the common law sponsorship living with partner requirements? I called up immigration a week or so ago and they said my partner could just stay on a vistor visa and we keep extending it until the year is over and we can apply for the common law sponsorship is this a viable way to do it ?? As this is what the immigration officer suggested on the phone thank you,"Yes, this is a way that many people do it, though it isn't without its downsides. The partner who is in Canada as a visitor cannot work, they cannot study. They will not be eligible for healthcare. They may or may not be able to open a bank account. 

Having one person live as a visitor for a full year isn't feasible for everyone. But it can be done, and yes you can extend your stay in order to stay for a full year. As long as you're able to prove your cohabitation at the end of the year, having been on a visitor visa won't pose any issues for sponsorship. 

Other options, of course, include looking into work or study permits for either person to live in the other country.",386,681
"Hello all! I know that for CL partnership, one must be living with a Canadian citizen for 12 continuous months.  Our plan is to use that for me to then sponsor my American partner. 

I know that *they* aren’t allowed to leave Canada even for a week in that period. What about me, the one who will be sponsoring them? Will I also have to be in Canada for 12 months straight? Or can I leave for 1-2 weeks for whatever without jeopardizing my partner and having to start counting the months from zero?","Common-law partnership doesn’t require either party to physically be in Canada without even a single brief interruption, no. The important thing is that any absences from the shared home are not the type that count as a break in the required continuous cohabitation in a marriage-like relationship.

For example, either of you making a solo 2-night business trip to New York City to close a deal and then returning home would be unlikely to affect the continuous cohabitation requirement, unless you were finding excuses like that to be away so much of the time that it felt to the officer like you were intentionally avoiding the shared home, or unless your partner is refused re-entry to Canada for whatever reason (so it’s riskier for them to travel outside Canada than for you). A 9-month work assignment to a distant location even within Canada could easily be viewed as breaking cohabitation, but it could be argued either way if you return home at every opportunity such as weekends and holidays, sometimes host your partner for visits, otherwise continue to stay in close contact, and so on.

If you’re trying to do the inland sponsorship method for spouses and common-law partners in Canada, the requirement is that they live in Canada together with you, not that they necessarily be physically in Canada without any interruption. Brief temporary trips outside Canada which do not lead to a refusal of re-entry and which do not end the reality of the joint residence in Canada would not prevent an application in this class class from proceeding. 

However, trips outside Canada are risky for this application class, because if your partner’s re-entry is refused or if the circumstances lead the officers to believe that either person’s actual residence has been shifted away from the common home in Canada, the application will be refused as ineligible for the inland sponsorship category.

Outland sponsorship would remain available even if inland sponsorship is refused as ineligible on this basis, as long as the required cohabitation for common-law partner status is retained - for example, this might be the case if both of you move your residence outside of Canada for an extended but temporary period, intending to move back to live together in Canada no later than when your partner becomes a permanent resident.

If you want the least risk of any problems with the sponsorship application due to either of you travelling outside Canada, legally marry before applying and use outland sponsorship as spouses, which makes their location entirely irrelevant to eligibility and your location far less relevant than in the common-law partner and inland sponsorship scenarios.",498,2688
"Hi everyone, I (24M , Canadian) and my girlfriend (23F, Peruvian) are trying to close the distance. We consider getting married to be able to qualify to Sponsership. 

I have a few questions about the proccess :

1 : Since Canada ask for a visa for peruvians, would it be possible for my girlfriend (wife in that case) to stay in Canada during the process?

2 : Is there a minimal income require to be able to sponser her (i've seen on internet that i need to have an income around 30 000$ for the last 12 months and i've also seen that it's not necessary)?

I know there is some differences between Quebec and the rest of Canada (as always) so i would like if someone can tell me about the specificities.

Thanks!","1.) assuming you are trying to do the inland sponsorship: it's a bit tricky trying to do it with a visitor status. You girlfriend can apply for one, but whether or not she will be granted one, is the other question. As long as she has no PR status in Canada, she has no right to enter. Should she be granted a visitor visa, then she may be allowed to enter, but she will still have to maintain her status. Being married to a Canadian or having a spousal sponsorship in process **does not** give her maintained status. She would need to extend her stay through a visitor record. So, in short, it's her responsibility to maintain a legal status in Canada throughout the whole process.  

2. There is no minimum required income for the spousal sponsorship. However, I'm not familiar with Quebecs requirements as I do know it's different than for the rest of Canada. Hopefully someone can share their knowledge for this point!",714,922
"So I have a Thai wife. I went to Thailand a few months ago and got married. She has also been to Canada last year to see me. She has a 10 year Canadian visitor visa. 

Now the next step for us is that she comes to Canada, and we apply for her PR in Canada. 

But I'm worried that I'm missing something when she gets to immigration. I bought her a one way ticket already. But will CBSA stop her at the border? Like, do we need some paper saying that she will apply for PR? Or can she just come in freely and we will apply? I'm just worried CBSA will see her one way ticket and think she will stay here illegally or something?

Thanks everyone who answers!","This is the tricky part about applying inland when the applicant is coming as a visitor: applying for PR does not grant her any status, and having the intention of applying for PR does not provide any exemption or any right to enter Canada. 

There is always a risk that anyone who isn't a citizen or permanent resident will be denied entry, and you are right that an officer may see her one way ticket and find out that her spouse is Canadian and think that she's higher risk for staying illegally. 

Canada allows you to have dual intent, meaning you're allowed to have the intention of staying permanently while coming temporarily. But, the officer assessing you at the border still has to be satisfied that you have the means and motivation to comply with the terms of your temporary stay. 

Your wife should be prepared, if asked, to demonstrate the ability to return home (showing bank statements or other proof of finances can help with this) and potentially reasons why she would want to return home: property, a job, family ties etc.

There is always a chance that she won't be questioned at all (my partner wasn't) but in case she is, she should be prepared to show that - if required of her - she would have the ability and reasons to return home.",654,1258

**FORM 5532:**  
 Address history, current address, what do I put under 'TO yyyy/mm' as I still live there on the day of the application?  
 

**PROOF OF RELOCATION:**  
 Does the sponsor need to provide proof of relocation on my behalf too?  We can add the resignation letter to my employer if necessary.  Otherwise, can the sponsor just add proof of plans of relocation for  herself only?

To me, settled status feels approximately the same as permanent resident, but it doesn’t too much matter whether you pick permanent resident or other if you’re planning to clarify in a letter of explanation.

“In general” question and Form 5532: again, do your best with the form and explain any confusion in a letter of explanation. These are read by humans who can understand explanations and not by machines which can’t.

Checklist 5533: No need to prove this to IRCC. At some point they will invite you apply to Quebec for their provincial approval. You’ll have to satisfy whatever requirements they have. But almost all spousal or common-law partner sponsorship scenarios do not have financial income or asset requirements beyond signing a 3-year undertaking to cover or reimburse certain expenses.

"Hi, I am sponsoring my partner under common-law sponsorship. We didn't enter the common-law relationship when I applied for PR under TR to PR Pathway until a few months later.

So I just want to know if this is going to affect my partner's application.

Thanks guys!!","If you did not declare them as your common-law partner (whether or not they were accompanying you to Canada) you will not be able to sponsor them due to misrepresentation. 

Applicants applying for PR are obligated to declare any changes to their marital status to IRCC. This will result in your added spouse/common-law partner having to complete a medical exam & background check (whether or not they are accompanying you to Canada). Their admissibility affects your admissibility which is why they are required to have the same exams performed on them, like you as the applicant. 

I find it odd that your lawyer did not advice you to complete the IMM0008 dependent form because this would led the IRCC to believe your partner is a PR/citizen of Canada already (are they a PR/citizen of Canada?). Assuming your common-law partner was not a PR/citizen at the time you entered your common-law relationship, you would have needed to declare them as a dependent on the IMM0008 & stated whether or not they are accompanying you. The only time you do **not** include a spouse/common-law partner as your dependent would be if they were already a PR/citizen of Canada. 

Have you consulted another professional about this? It's very important that you get this figured out what exactly happened & if your common-law partner was properly declared.",531,1340

"Hello, 

I was hoping to get some advice for a friend (M, 30) who just realized his wife has just been after PR all along. We do plan on seeking advice from an immigration divorce lawyer soon but he's resources and money are very limited at the moment and he also has a learning disability. Hoping to get some advice and how to get his duck in a row.

Background: My friend met his now wife while she was in Canada on a student visa. Shortly after meeting, she got pregnant and she insisted for a marriage before the child was born. My friend thinking they would be life partners agreed. 

Unfortunately, now the marriage is quickly falling apart and the wife has done a 180 personality change since the marriage and childbirth. They have been married for 12 months and the child is 11 months. My friend has text evidence of his wife saying things a long the lines of ""I just want my PR and after I will leave you alone."" Along with other text evidence of her saying things like if he divorces her, she will keep the child away from him forever and also change the child's identity. My friend just wants visitation with the child. 

Her PR application is currently still pending, she does not have her PR yet. Will he be able to withdraw the application or does she automatically get to stay because her child is a Canadian citizen? Will he be liable for all her expenses? My friend does not mind paying for the child or child support but will he be responsible financially for her as well? What steps can he take to protect himself. Thank you kindly in advance.","Your friend needs to withdraw the sponsorship application ASAP, while the application is still being processed and so while he can still withdraw the application, before it's too late.

If he doesn't withdraw and the application gets approved, your friend would be on the hook to repay social assistance (welfare) the wife uses, within the 3 years following the day she obtains PR status (yes, even if they get a divorce within those 3 years; a divorce doesn't erase the sponsor's obligations regarding the 3 year sponsorship undertaking).

The questions about the child custody and visitation rights are a family law matter, not an immigration law one, so those questions are outside the scope of this subreddit and would be more appropriate for a more general subreddit such as r/legaladvicecanada instead of this one.",1562,820

"I've received my request for medical today and am doing the spousal sponsorship outland. There are no approved physicians in my state and the closest doctor I can find is 4.5 hours drive away. Is this normal?

Are there any concessions that can be made like going to a doctor near me so I don't have to spend an entire day(s) traveling just to have someone mark that I don't have any medical conditions on a form?

This is ridiculous - what options do I have here?","Yes, it is normal.

There are people who don't have a panel physician in their country, at all, and who literally have to get a visa and fly to a neighboring country to do it, so no, a 4.5 hours drive is not that bad; at least you don't need to apply for a visitor visa and fly to a different country to do it.

No, there aren't any concessions. Immigration medical exams need to be done by panel physicians. 

A medical exam done by a doctor near you, who isn't a panel physician, would not be a valid medical exam for Canadian immigration purposes.

And no, it's not just about completing a form stating you don't have any medical conditions; you'd need to take blood and urine tests and and an x-ray as part of the immigration medical exam process; read the panel physician handbook for more information:

"Hi everyone,

How long is the police certificate from the US (FBI) valid for when it comes to spousal sponsorship? 

I've seen answers that range from 90 days to 6 months but would like to make sure specifically for spousal sponsorship (and not EE). 

For context, I got mine a bit too preemptively end of January 2023 and am worried that if I don't submit my application by end of April, my original certificate won't be valid anymore (90 days will pass by end of April). 

Aside from the cost it's not a big deal to just get another one but would rather not have to go through the process if my current certificate will be valid for 6 months. I intend to submit my application within the next month.

" Hi All,

Can I apply for a visitor visa for my wife while her spouse sponsorship visa is in progress? I have received her Acknowledgment of Receipt (AOR) but have not received any updates after that. I have heard about something called a dual intent Visit visa, can anyone please elaborate on it and provide advice.

Like what are the chances of approval? Since there will be two applications being processed at the same time.

I am a PR here.  
TIA","A sponsorship application is an application for permanent residence. It is not a visa. 

There is no such thing as a 'dual intent visa.' There is also no declaration of dual intent that you can make, and you cannot 'claim' dual intent when crossing the border. All of these things are widespread misconceptions. 

Dual intent is simply the concept that someone can be in Canada temporarily and have the intent of abiding by the rules of their temporary stay, while also have the intent to hopefully stay permanently. Unlike other countries, Canada allows you to have dual intent, meaning that you can apply for a temporary resident status while having an application for permanent residence in process, and vice versa, and that having one will not cause a rejection of the other. 

So, yes, you can apply for a visitor visa for your wife while her PR is in process. One will not cancel or affect the other, and the processing timeline of one will not be impacted by the other.

However, while you are allowed to have dual intent, an officer still has to be satisfied that you will comply with the requirements of your temporary stay, meaning that the officer has to believe that, should the PR be refused, that you have the means, motivation and ability to leave when your temporary stay is over. 

For this reason, it can be difficult to obtain a visitor visa when a sponsorship is in process: the agent assessing the visitor visa application may feel that the chances of someone leaving at the end of their allowed stay is lower if their spouse is in Canada, and they've started to wrap up their life back home in order to facilitate moving to Canada. The more evidence you can provide that she still has ties back home, and that she would be willing and able to return home when her visit is over, the better.",450,1812

"Hi everyone!

I think I have a quiet complex situation and want to know the opinion of you guys. As couldn’t find much answer for our case. 

Problem #1
She already got pre arrival, and COPR number and expiration date 4 weeks ago, yay! But didn’t receive any email for these latest update and not portal invitation. she pretty quickly found out her Gmail data storage was full, and was upgraded 3 or 4 days after she got her COPR. We immediately made a Webform to explain ircc, but no answer since.

Problem #2
We started looking for a solution and found out about GC key (a bit late). Her GC key account was now made 5 days ago and linked her application, but the application is not up to date with the spousal tracker (latest update is medical passed, no copr), and show no message in the message centre. We sent a GC key Webform to inform them.

Problem #3
IRCC had made a mistake for her physical home address. (that we originally thought it was the mailing address, so didn’t try to corrected) but right around the time she got COPR on spousal tracker, they corrected by themselves. I am starting to think that this could be causing delays as IRCC just had to transfer our case to a new visa office.

Are we currently in a limbo? Or is our case processing the way it should be?
I have also sent a Webform for technical difficulties and a Webform for New York VA (as her residence is in New Hampshire).

Thank you very much and hope everything is fine!","The COPR number that appears in the tracker is not COPR. We don't know why the number appears in the tracker, presumably it's something done on IRCC's part in the backend, but it is not the official COPR. 

It is not unusual for applicants to see the COPR number/expiry appear and not receive approval for a few months. It's also not unusual for the COPR number/expiry that appear in the tracker to change when COPR is actually issued. 

If she's an outland applicant (as you've said she lives in New Hampshire) she will not receive a portal invitation. She will instead receive a passport request via email. After she submits her passport, then COPR will be issued. 

This is why there's no COPR in GCKey: it has not yet been issued as she has not submitted her passport/received the passport request. 

If she missed the email requesting her passport, hopefully that will come soon and it's good that you've sent a webform, as they can hopefully resend.
