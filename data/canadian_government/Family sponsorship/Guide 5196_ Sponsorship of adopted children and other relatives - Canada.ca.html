</div>
<div class="mwsgeneric-base-html parbase section">



    <p>The Canadian government allows citizens and permanent residents of Canada to sponsor members of the family class, but it requires that arriving immigrants receive care and support from their sponsors.</p>
<p>Members of the family class include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a sponsor’s spouse</li>
  <li>a sponsor’s&nbsp;common-law partner or conjugal partner</li>
  <li>a sponsor’s dependent child</li>
  <li>a sponsor’s parent</li>
  <li>a person the sponsor intends to adopt</li>
  <li>and other relatives of the sponsor as defined by regulation</li>

        <h3>Who may use this application?</h3>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsgeneric-base-html parbase section">



    <p>Use this application package if you’re a Canadian citizen, Registered Indian or a permanent resident of Canada who is 18 years of age or older and you want to sponsor:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Children that are adopted or to be adopted and persons who wish to be re-united with close family members in Canada. In order to use this application package, you must, with respect to the sponsor, be
		<ul>
			<li>a child they adopted outside Canada or intends to adopt in Canada,</li>
			<li>their sibling, nephew, niece, grandchild, and be an orphan, under the age of 18 and not a spouse or common-law partner,</li>
			<li>their relative, regardless of your age, if the sponsor does not have a spouse, common-law partner, conjugal partner, child, parent, sibling, grandparent, uncle, aunt, nephew or niece, who is a Canadian citizen, Indian or permanent resident or whose application for permanent residence in Canada they could sponsor.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Please be aware that individuals who are adopted by Canadian Citizens may be eligible for Canadian citizenship. Learn more about the <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadians/adopt-child-abroad/processes/choose-process/citizenship/eligibility.html">application process for citizenship grants for adopted persons</a>.</p>
<p>Use this guide to help you prepare:</p>
<ul>
	<li>your application to sponsor an adopted child or orphaned family member OR</li>
	<li>other family members who are not your spouse, partner or dependent child.</li>
</ul>
	
<h3>Adopted children and orphaned relatives</h3>
<p>A permanent resident visa cannot be issued to a child as a member of the family class if that child is the adopted child of the sponsor or an orphaned brother, sister, nephew or niece of the sponsor, unless the adoptive parents/the sponsor demonstrate they have obtained information concerning the medical condition of the child. In doing so, the government ensures that the child’s best interests are protected. </p>
<p>The sponsor must complete and submit a <a href="/content/dam/ircc/documents/pdf/english/kits/forms/imm0133e.pdf">Medical Condition Statement [IMM 0133] (PDF, 2.3 MB)</a> if they have not already done so with their sponsorship application.</p>

        <h3>What does it mean to sponsor?</h3>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <p>When you sponsor persons who are members of the family class, you must sign an undertaking with the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship (or with the <span lang="fr">Ministère de l'Immigration, de la Francisation et de l'Intégration</span> [MIFI] if you live in Quebec).</p>
<p>The undertaking is a promise to provide financial support and basic requirements for the family members you are sponsoring.</p>
<p><strong>Basic requirements</strong> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>food</li>
<li>clothing</li>
<li>utilities</li>
<li>personal requirements</li>
<li>shelter</li>
<li>fuel</li>
<li>household supplies</li>
</ul>
<p>This also includes health care not provided by public health, such as eye and dental care.</p>
<p>The undertaking ensures that these persons and their family members do not have to apply for social assistance. The length of the undertaking and duration of time you are to provide support varies according to their age and relationship to you.</p>
<p>Your obligations as a sponsor begin as soon as the person you are sponsoring and, if applicable, their family members arrive in Canada.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <p><img alt="" src="/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/information/applications/guides/images/exclamation_sm.gif" class="pull-left mrgn-rght-sm">Important information: The <strong>undertaking</strong> is an unconditional promise of support. For example, the granting of Canadian citizenship, divorce, separation or relationship breakdown or moving to another province does not cancel the undertaking. The undertaking also remains in effect even if your financial situation deteriorates.</p>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <p>Your spouse or common-law partner may help you meet the income requirement by co-signing the sponsorship application. A common-law partner is a person who is living with you in a conjugal relationship and has done so for at least one year prior to the signing of the undertaking.</p>
<p>The co-signer must:</p>
<ul>
<li>meet the same eligibility requirements as the sponsor;</li>
<li>agree to co-sign the undertaking; and</li>
<li>agree to be responsible for the basic requirements of the person you want to sponsor and their family members for the validity period of the undertaking.</li>
</ul>
<p>The co-signer will be equally liable if obligations are not performed.</p>

        <p>The province of Quebec is responsible for determining whether sponsors living in the province have the financial ability to sponsor family members and the length of the undertaking.</p>
<p>The province of Quebec has its own immigration rules. Find out how to sponsor someone if you live in Quebec.</p>
<p>If you live in Quebec:</p>
<ul>
<li>you must first send us your application.</li>
<li>if you meet the federal requirements to apply for sponsorship, we will send you an email or letter with instructions to download Quebec’s sponsorship kit.</li>
<li>fill out and submit Quebec’s undertaking kit. You must attach a copy of the email or letter we sent you to the undertaking application that you submit to the Quebec government.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Quebec government will review your sponsorship application and tell you if you’re eligible. The Quebec government may deem that you’re not eligible if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you didn’t meet the terms of a sponsorship agreement in the past because the person you sponsored received social assistance and you haven’t repaid the Quebec government;</li>
<li>during the five years before you submitted your sponsorship application, you didn’t pay alimony or child support even though a court ordered it;</li>
<li>you didn’t follow other conditions imposed by the Quebec authorities or with any federal regulatory requirements, particularly if you received social assistance and aren’t exempt from that condition.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can’t make a decision on your application until we receive Quebec’s decision about your undertaking application.</p>
<p>The Quebec government will inform IRCC if you are approved as a sponsor.</p>
<p>If the federal eligibility requirements are met, we will send the sponsor a letter with instructions to download the MIFI undertaking kit, then to complete and submit it to the MIFI with a copy of the letter we sent you.</p>
<p>For more information on Quebec’s requirements, or if you need help, you may call MIFI’s general information line at 514-864-9191 or 1-877-864-9191 or consult the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.immigration-quebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/home.html">MIFI website</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <ol>
<li><p>Count:</p>

<li>dependent children, if applicable. See the “<a href="#child">Definition of dependent child</a> (types&nbsp;1 and 2)”</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-info"><p><strong>Note:</strong> Dependent children who meet this definition must be included in the calculation, even if you as a sponsor do not have custody nor provide child support.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Count:</p>
<ul>
<li>the number of persons you are now sponsoring and</li>
<li>all family members of that person, whether or not they are accompanying.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Count the number of persons covered by other <strong>valid undertakings you</strong> have made or co-signed in the past.</li>
<li>If you have a <strong>co-signer</strong>, count all persons covered by still <strong>valid undertakings</strong> made or co-signed by your co-signer.</li>
<li>Calculate the number of persons covered in steps&nbsp;1 to&nbsp;4. The total represents the family size</li>
<li>Look at the <a href="#table1">Income tables and charts</a> at the end of this guide to help you decide if you have the financial ability to meet sponsorship requirements. Note that your calculations will only be an estimate.</li>

    <h3>Does the principal applicant need to include a child in the sole custody of a former spouse or partner in their application?</h3>
<p>The principal applicant must list all children who are in the sole custody of a former spouse or partner on the application for permanent residence since all family members, whether accompanying or not, must be declared and examined. If a child is not examined, the principal applicant will not be able to sponsor the child as a member of the family class in the future, regardless of changes to custody or living circumstances. To preserve the right to sponsor that child in the future, the child must be included and examined.</p>

<h3>Do I need a passport or travel document?</h3>
<p>You must have a valid passport or travel documents. If any of the documents are to expire soon, you should renew them and provide copies of the new passport or travel document to the office processing your application.</p>
<p>Diplomatic, official, service or public affairs passports cannot be used to immigrate to Canada. You must have a valid regular or private passport when you arrive.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> The validity of your visa may be affected by the validity of your passport.</p>

<h3>How long is a permanent resident visa valid?</h3>
<p>A permanent resident visa is issued for a period not exceeding the earliest expiry date of the following documents:</p>
<ul>
	<li>your medical results <strong>or</strong></li>
	<li>your passport.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important information:</strong> Permanent resident visas cannot be extended once issued. If applicants do not use the visas within their validity period, they must re-apply for immigration to Canada. Their sponsor will have to submit a new sponsorship application and pay new processing fees.</p>

<h3>Staying informed</h3>
<p>Selection criteria, requirements and other information for applicants can sometimes change. Please note that:</p>

    <p>Common-law partners who have been in a conjugal relationship for at least one year, but are unable to live together or appear in public together because of legal restrictions in their home country or who have been separated for reasons beyond their control (for example, civil war or armed conflict) may still qualify and should be included on the application.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>They’re <strong>under 22 years old</strong>, <strong>and</strong></li>

      <li>They are unable to financially support themselves because of a mental or physical condition</li>

    <h3>Communicating with IRCC</h3>
<p>There are several ways we may communicate with you:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Through your (or your representative’s) online account:</strong> We recommend that you or your authorized paid representative (if applicable) create an online account and link your application to that account. Once an application has been linked to an online account, we will send correspondence there. This makes communication easier, more secure, and quicker and will allow you or your representative to get more detailed application status information and to receive mail from us online. Using online services will ensure that you receive any correspondence (including medical forms and other requests) from us almost immediately after we send it to you. This will allow us to input your responses directly into your application for timely review. </li>
	<li><strong>E-Mail:</strong> If you or your representative provide us with an e-mail address when you apply, this will be our primary means of contacting you, unless your application is linked to an online account.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Do not attempt to link your application to your personal online account if you have appointed a representative. If you have appointed a representative and attempt to link your application to your own online account, you will have to cancel your representative before you can link.</p>
<p>If you have an authorized paid representative, they can link your application to their own online account instead.</p>
<p>Unpaid representatives cannot use online accounts. If you have an unpaid representative, you should remind them to regularly monitor their e-mail and mail to ensure correspondence is received.</p>
<p>When you authorize the use of a representative, they’ll receive all correspondence about the application on your behalf. It’s important to make sure that we always have your, and your representative’s (if applicable) most current contact information, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Phone numbers</li>
	<li>Email addresses</li>
	<li>Mailing addresses</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll send time-sensitive and official correspondence using the most up-to-date contact information we have.</p>
<p>If we send a request, an answer must be provided within the timeframe provided.</p>
<p>For more information, see our Help Centre for instruction on <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/account/link-paper-online.html">changing your address or contact information</a>.</p>

	<p><strong>Note:</strong> If your application was received before someone else’s, but you have not received all of the same requests, don’t be alarmed. Each file is different, and application steps may happen at different times for each file. We will contact you when:</p>
<ul>
	<li>we need more information to process your file</li>
	<li>an update is available</li>
	<li>a decision has been made, or</li>
	<li>if your file is transferred to another office for processing</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure you regularly check to see if we have contacted you.</p>
<p>Be sure to check the email you gave us when you submitted if you</p>
<ul>
	<li>are waiting to hear about your application or</li>
	<li>think there may be forms or documents missing</li>
