<h3 id="use">Who can use this application package?</h3>
<p>Use this application package if you’re a Canadian citizen, Registered Indian or a permanent resident of Canada who is 18 years of age or older and you want to sponsor:</p>
<ul>
<li>your spouse or common-law partner who lives with you in Canada, and their dependent children</li>
<li>your spouse, common-law partner or conjugal partner who lives overseas, and their dependent children</li>
<li>your dependent children</li>
</ul>
<p>Use this guide to help you prepare both:</p>
<ul>
<li>your application to sponsor your spouse, partner or dependent child, and</li>
<li>your spouse, partner or dependent child’s application for permanent residence.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re applying under the Spouse or Common-law partner in Canada class, your spouse or partner may be able to apply for an Open Work Permit. For more information, see the section <a href="#work">Working and studying for spouses and partners</a>.</p>
<p>Don’t use this guide if you’re sponsoring:</p>
<ul>
<li>an adopted child or orphaned family member</li>
<li>other family members who are not your spouse, partner or dependent child.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re sponsoring a family member other than your spouse, common-law partner, conjugal partner, or dependent child, use the <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/applying-member-family-class-sponsorship-adopted-children-other-relatives.html">sponsorship package for adopted children and other relatives</a> instead.</p>

<h2 id="obligations">Your obligations as a sponsor</h2>
<p>When you agree to be a sponsor, you must sign an <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/section-133.html">undertaking</a>, promising to give financial support for the basic needs of your spouse or partner and their dependent children.</p>
<p>Basic needs are:</p>
<ul>
<li>food, clothing, shelter and other needs for everyday living,</li>
<li>dental care, eye care and other health needs that aren’t covered by public health services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before signing the undertaking agreement, you must make sure the people you sponsor won’t need to ask the government for financial help. If they receive social assistance, you’ll have to pay back what they received during the time you are legally responsible for them. You won’t be able to sponsor anyone else until you’ve repaid the amount. For more information, see the <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/guide-5289-sponsor-your-spouse-common-law-partner-conjugal-partner-dependent-child-complete-guide.html#defaults">Defaults section below</a>.</p>
<p>The undertaking is a binding promise of support, meaning that it is your responsibility to support the applicant(s) for the length of the undertaking period even if your situation changes. The undertaking will stay in effect for the length of the undertaking period, even if your situation changes. The undertaking won’t be cancelled, even if:</p>
<ul>
<li>the person you sponsor becomes a Canadian citizen</li>
<li>you become divorced, separated or your relationship with the sponsored person breaks down</li>
<li>you or the person you sponsor move to another province or country</li>
<li>you have financial problems</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cancel">May I cancel my undertaking after it’s been approved?</h3>
<p>If you change your mind after you submit the sponsorship application and undertaking, you must write us a letter <strong>before</strong> a final decision is made on the file and submit the letter as an attachment through the <a href="https://secure.cic.gc.ca/enquiries-renseignements/canada-case-cas-eng.aspx">IRCC Webform</a>. You can only withdraw an undertaking if we approve the withdrawal.</p>
<h3 id="length">Length of undertaking</h3>
<p>Your obligations as a sponsor start as soon as the undertaking is in effect. If you change your mind after you submit the sponsorship application and undertaking, you must write us a letter <strong>before</strong> a final decision is made on the file and submit the letter as an attachment through the <a href="https://secure.cic.gc.ca/enquiries-renseignements/canada-case-cas-eng.aspx">IRCC Webform</a>. You can only withdraw an undertaking if we approve the withdrawal. See Step 6 to find out <a href="#mail">where to mail your letter</a>.</p>
<p>The length of undertaking for residents of Quebec is different from the length of undertaking for the rest of Canada. For more information about sponsoring a family member in Quebec, see detailed information for <a href="https://www.quebec.ca/en/immigration/sponsor-family-member/sponsor-other-family-member/obligations-undertaking" rel="external">length of undertaking for residents of Quebec</a>.</p>
<p>For sponsorships in all parts of Canada except for Quebec, the information below explains how long your undertaking will be valid.</p>
<h4>You’re sponsoring a spouse, common-law partner or conjugal partner</h4>
<p>Length of undertaking is <strong>3 years</strong> from the day your spouse, common-law partner or conjugal partner becomes a permanent resident.</p>
<h4>You’re sponsoring a dependent child over 22 years of age</h4>
<p>Length of undertaking is <strong>3 years</strong> from the day your <strong>dependent child</strong> (or the dependent child of your spouse, common-law partner or conjugal partner) over <strong>22 years of age</strong> becomes a permanent resident.</p>
<h4>You’re sponsoring a dependent child under 22 years of age</h4>
<p>Length of undertaking is <strong>10 years</strong> from the day your <strong>dependent child</strong> (or the dependent child of your spouse, common-law partner or conjugal partner) under <strong>22 years of age</strong> becomes a permanent resident, or <strong>until the child becomes 25 years old</strong>, whichever comes first. The <a href="https://www.quebec.ca/en/immigration/sponsor-family-member/sponsor-other-family-member/obligations-undertaking" rel="external">length of undertaking for residents of Quebec</a> is slightly different.</p>
<div class="alert alert alert-info">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You’ll be in default if your relative gets social assistance from the government while the undertaking is in effect.</p>

<h2 id="eligibility">Become a sponsor</h2>
<h3>You can become a sponsor if you are:</h3>
<ul>
<li>at least 18 years old</li>
<li>a Canadian citizen, a person registered in Canada as an Indian under the Canadian <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-5/">Indian Act</a> or a permanent resident,</li>
<li>living in Canada:
    <ul>
<li>if you’re a Canadian citizen living outside Canada, you must show that you plan to live in Canada when your sponsored relative becomes a permanent resident.</li>
<li>You can’t sponsor someone if you’re a permanent resident living outside of Canada.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>able to prove that you are not receiving social assistance for reasons other than a disability, and;</li>
</ul>
<p>You must also be able to show that you can provide basic needs for:</p>
<ul>
<li>yourself,</li>
<li>your spouse or partner,</li>
<li>your spouse or partner’s dependent child(ren) (if applicable)</li>
<li>your dependent child(ren) (if you’re sponsoring only your dependent child).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In most cases, if you are sponsoring a spouse, partner or dependent child, there is no minimum necessary income (MNI) requirement you need to meet. However, you must meet the minimum income requirement if the spouse or partner you’re sponsoring has a dependent child who has dependent child of their own, or the dependent child you are sponsoring has a dependent child of their own. The income requirement is based on Statistics Canada’s annual Low-income Cut-Off (LICO).</p>
<p>If you must meet the MNI requirement, you must include a <a href="http://www.ircc.canada.ca/english/information/applications/guides/5482Eguide.asp">Financial Evaluation (IMM 1283) form</a> with your application (see your checklist for more details). If you live in Quebec, you don’t have to submit this form to IRCC. See subsection 1(3) of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/"><em>Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR)</em></a> for more information.</p>
<p>If you live in Quebec, you must also meet <a href="https://www.quebec.ca/en/immigration/sponsor-family-member/sponsor-other-family-member/verifying-your-eligibility">Quebec’s conditions to be a sponsor</a>.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p>You can still sponsor if you are receiving maternity, parental and sickness benefits paid under the Employment Insurance Act. These benefits <strong>also count as income for the purposes of meeting the MNI</strong>.</p>
<p>You can still sponsor if you are receiving regular Employment Insurance and federal training allowances. These benefits don’t normally count towards income for the purposes of meeting the MNI.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> For the 2020 and 2021 tax years only, a public policy was established that allows sponsors of all family class applicants whose sponsor must meet income requirements to count regular Employment Insurance benefits in their income calculations rather than just special Employment Insurance benefits.</p>

<li>are sponsoring a spouse or partner but you signed an undertaking for a previous spouse or partner and it hasn’t been three years since they became a permanent resident,</li>

<h3>Sponsoring your spouse, common-law partner or conjugal partner</h3>
<p>These terms apply to couples of any gender.</p>
<h4>If you’re married</h4>
<p>You can sponsor the person as your <strong>spouse</strong> if your marriage is a legally valid civil marriage.</p>
<p>Marriages:</p>
<ul>
<li>will be recognized for immigration purposes, where the marriage:
    <ol>
<li>was legally performed in Canada, or</li>
<li>if performed outside of Canada, the marriage must be legally recognized both in the country where it took place and in Canada.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>IRCC does not recognize marriages performed outside of Canada by proxy, telephone, fax, Internet and other forms of marriage where one or both persons were not physically present at the ceremony.

<h4>If you’re in a common-law relationship</h4>
<p>You can sponsor the person as your <strong>common-law partner (any gender) </strong>as long as you’ve been living or have lived with your partner for <strong>at least 12 consecutive months</strong> in a marriage-like relationship.</p>
<h4>If you’re in conjugal relationship</h4>
<p>A conjugal partner is:</p>
<ul>
<li>a person who is living outside Canada,</li>
<li>in a conjugal relationship with the sponsor for at least one year</li>
</ul>
<p>You can sponsor a <strong>conjugal partner</strong> if:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is a significant degree of attachment between the two of you, implying not just a physical relationship but a mutually interdependent relationship, <strong>and</strong></li>
<li>you’ve been in a genuine (real) relationship for at least 12 months where marriage or cohabitation (living together) hasn’t been possible for any reason.</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert alert-info">
<p><strong class="text-uppercase">Important:</strong> If you’re applying in the conjugal partner class, the person being sponsored <strong>cannot</strong> be living in Canada.</p>

<h3 id="incanada">Sponsoring your spouse or common-law partner who lives with you in Canada</h3>
<p>You can apply under the Spouse or Common-Law Partner in Canada class if your spouse or common-law partner cohabits (lives) with you in Canada.</p>
<p>Your spouse or common-law partner must either:</p>
<ul>
<li>have valid temporary residence status or</li>
<li>be exempt from needing this status under a public policy that was set out in 2005</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/immigration-refugee-protection-act-spousal-policy.html#3">public policy</a>, a person without temporary resident status can be sponsored as a spouse or common-law partner in Canada only if they are inadmissible because they:</p>

<li>worked or studied without being legally allowed to do so under the Act;</li>
<li>entered Canada without the required visa or other document required under the regulations;</li>
<li>entered Canada without a valid passport or travel document (as long as they have valid documents by the time they are granted permanent residence).</li>
</ul>
<p>If your spouse or common-law partner is inadmissible for other reasons, they’re not covered by the public policy. In that case, they should resolve the situation that made them inadmissible before applying for permanent residence.</p>
<p>Your spouse or partner may be eligible for an open work permit. For more information, see the section about <a href="#work">Working and studying for spouses and partners below</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="pull-left mrgn-rght-sm" src="/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/information/applications/guides/images/exclamation_sm.gif"/>Important information: if your spouse or partner is already working or studying in Canada and would like to continue, they must apply for an extension before their work or study permit expires.</p>
<p>Leaving Canada can automatically cancel temporary resident status as a visitor, student or worker.</p>
<p>If your spouse or common-law partner leaves Canada before becoming a permanent resident, they may not be allowed to come back. This is especially true if they need a Temporary Resident Visa or an eTA to enter Canada.</p>
<p>If your spouse or partner can’t return to Canada, you must submit a new overseas sponsorship application.</p>

<p><strong>Not sure if your child is a dependant?</strong> <a href="https://ircc.canada.ca/english/immigrate/sponsor/aod-tool.asp">Check if your child qualifies by answering a few questions</a>.</p>
<p>Your child or the child of your spouse or common-law partner can be considered a dependent child if that child meets the requirements below on the day we receive your complete application:</p>
<ul>
<li>They’re <strong>under 22 years old</strong>, and</li>
<li>They don’t have a spouse or common-law partner</li>
</ul>
<p>Children 22 years old or older qualify as dependants if they meet <strong>both</strong> of these requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>They have depended on their parents for financial support since before the age of 22, and</li>
<li>They are unable to financially support themselves because of a mental or physical condition</li>
</ul>
<p>With the exception of age, dependants must continue to meet these requirements until we finish processing your application.</p>
<p>If your child’s age was locked in on or before October 23, 2017, a previous <a href="http://www.ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/glossary.asp#dependent_child">definition of dependent children</a> may apply.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: If the person you are sponsoring (or their child) has one or more children in the sole custody of their other parent, you must still declare the child in the application. Even if there’s a written agreement or court order to show that the sponsored person doesn’t have custody or responsibility, you must list the child on the application and this child must undergo a medical exam and pass any applicable background and security checks. Doing this gives the sponsored person the possibility to sponsor their child as a member of the family class in the future, when there may be changes to the custody or living arrangements. <strong>If a permanent resident doesn’t declare all their family members on their application, they could risk losing their permanent resident status.</strong></p>
<h4>The person you’re sponsoring has a child in the sole custody of a previous spouse. Do they need to include this child in their application?</h4>
<p>Yes. Children in the custody of a previous spouse or partner are considered dependent children.</p>
<p>Even if there’s a written agreement or court order to show that the sponsored person doesn’t have custody or responsibility, you must list the child on the application and this child must undergo a medical exam and pass any background and security checks, if applicable.</p>
<p>Doing this gives the sponsored person the possibility to sponsor their child as a member of the family class in the future, when there may be changes to the custody or living arrangements. <strong>Also, if a permanent resident doesn’t declare all of their family members on their application, they could risk losing their permanent resident status.</strong></p>
<h2 id="passports">Passports for family members</h2>
<p>The person you’re sponsoring and their accompanying family members must have valid passports or travel documents when they arrive. Any documents that are about to expire should be renewed. The person being sponsored should send copies of the new passport or travel document to the office processing the application.</p>
<p>If the passport of the person you are sponsoring or their accompanying family members (if applicable) is renewed or replaced while their application is in process, you must advise us as soon as possible to avoid any delays.</p>
<p>You can’t use diplomatic, official, service, or public affairs passports to immigrate to Canada. The person being sponsored must have a valid regular or private passport when they arrive.</p>
<div class="alert alert alert-info">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The validity of a visa may be affected by the validity of the passport.</p>
</div>
<h2>How long is a permanent resident visa valid?</h2>
<p>A permanent resident visa is issued for a period not extending beyond the earliest expiry date of the sponsored person’s (and any family members): </p>
<ul>
<li>passports</li>
<li>medical results</li>
<li>admissibility results</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" class="pull-left mrgn-rght-sm" src="/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/information/applications/guides/images/exclamation_sm.gif"/>Important information: Once issued, permanent resident visas can’t be extended. If applicants don’t use the visas within their validity period, they must re-apply for immigration to Canada. Their sponsor will have to submit a new sponsorship application and pay new processing fees.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="criminality">Criminality</h2>
<p>Generally, people with criminal convictions are not allowed to come to Canada.</p>
<h3>Convictions or offences outside Canada</h3>
<p>If the person you’re sponsoring is outside Canada and has committed or has been convicted of a crime outside Canada, they may be able to overcome this criminal inadmissibility. This section doesn’t apply to anyone applying from within Canada and with a conviction or offense outside Canada. Find out <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/inadmissibility/overcome-criminal-convictions.html">how to overcome criminal convictions</a>.</p>
<p>The person can apply for rehabilitation either:</p>
<ul>
<li>before you submit the sponsorship application, or</li>
<li>by submitting the rehabilitation application with your application for sponsorship. If you choose this option, we’ll assess your eligibility as a sponsor and do the first assessment of the permanent resident application. However, we’ll only assess the sponsored person’s admissibility after they get a decision about their rehabilitation application.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the offence would have been prosecuted summarily in Canada, and if the person was convicted of two or more of these offences, the period for rehabilitation is at least five years after they’ve finished serving the sentences.</p>
<h3>Convictions or offences in Canada</h3>
<p>If the person has a criminal conviction in Canada, they must ask for a record suspension (formerly a pardon) from the Parole Board of Canada (PBC) before becoming admissible to Canada.</p>
<p><strong>The sponsored person should not fill out the forms in this guide until they have their record suspension.</strong> You can ask for a <a href="/en/parole-board/services/record-suspensions.html">Record Suspension Application Guide</a> or for more information from:</p>

</ul>
<p>To be considered for a record suspension under the Criminal Records Act, a set period of time must pass after the end of the sentence. The sentence may have been payment of a fine, period of probation, or a prison term.</p>
<div class="alert alert alert-info">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once you have a copy of the record suspension, send a photocopy to a Canadian visa office or an IRCC Centre. If the sponsored person is travelling to Canada, they should carry a copy of the record suspension.</p>
</div>
<p>If the person has had two or more summary convictions in Canada, they may no longer be inadmissible if:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s been at least five years since they finished serving all sentences</li>
<li>they’ve had no other convictions.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>you didn’t meet the terms of a sponsorship agreement in the past because the person you sponsored received social assistance and you haven’t repaid the Quebec government;</li>
<li>during the five years before you submitted your sponsorship application, you didn’t pay alimony or child support even though a court ordered it;</li>
<li>you didn’t follow other conditions imposed by the Quebec authorities or with any federal regulatory requirements, particularly if you received social assistance and aren’t exempt from that condition.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re applying for permanent residence in Canada, you <strong>must</strong> declare all of your <a href="http://www.ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/glossary.asp#family_members" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/linktracker/english/Guide5289/internal/fam_members1');">family members</a>.

<p>In addition, all family members must be examined as part of the process of applying for permanent residence in Canada, even if they will not come to Canada with the principal applicant.</p>
<p>Family members who aren’t declared and examined are excluded from the family class, which means you can’t sponsor them at a later date. <strong>If a permanent resident doesn’t declare all their family members on their application, they could risk losing their permanent resident status</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="fees">Step 4. Pay the fees</h2>
<p>Before you send us your application, use the fee table below to find out how much you need to pay when submitting your application.</p>
<p>We recommend you pay the <a href="http://www.ircc.canada.ca/english/information/fees/fees.asp#rprf">right of permanent resident fee</a> (RPRF) now. You’ll have to pay it before you become a permanent resident. This fee is refundable if you don’t become a permanent resident. You may choose to pay this fee later, however this may cause delays. (Note: Dependent children don’t need to pay the right of permanent residence fee. This includes any dependent child sponsored as a principal applicant.)</p>

<h2 id="check">Step 5. Check your application to avoid common mistakes</h2>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p><strong>Important information: </strong>If you don’t include all of the requested forms and documents listed on the checklist, your whole application will be returned to you without being processed. Incomplete applications will not have a place in the processing queue. If you resubmit your application and we then confirm it is complete, we’ll process it based on the date that the resubmission is received.</p>
</div>
<p>Before moving on to Step 6, check to make sure you’ve avoided these common mistakes:</p>
<h3>Regardless of who you are sponsoring:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Always check country specific requirements before submitting your application.</li>
</ul>
<h3>If you’re sponsoring dependent children</h3>
<ul>
<li>If the principal applicant is a dependent child, including someone younger than 18 years old, you must submit the digital Additional Family Information (IMM 5406) form and list them as the principal applicant. As the parent/legal guardian of the principal applicant who is under 18 years of age, you’ll sign the application on their behalf</li>
<li>If sponsoring more than one dependent child as a principal applicant, make sure you submit separate complete applications for each child (i.e. each child should be listed on their own <a href="/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/kits/forms/imm1344e.pdf">Application to Sponsor, Sponsorship Agreement and Undertaking [IMM 1344] (PDF, 0.70 MB)</a> and the digital form Generic Application Form for Canada (IMM 0008).</li>
<li>If sponsoring a dependent child (under the age of 18) and they have another parent who is not immigrating to Canada, the parent/guardian applying from Canada must submit a signed copy of the <a href="/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/kits/forms/imm5604e.pdf">Declaration From Non-Accompanying Parent/Guardian For Minors Immigrating to Canada [IMM 5604] (PDF, 1.37 MB)</a>. This form must be accompanied by a piece of photo identification from the parent/guardian who is NOT accompanying the minor to Canada. In situations where having this form signed from the other parent is impossible (i.e. parent’s whereabouts unknown), a letter of explanation must be included with the application. An officer will review this explanation and advise you of any next steps.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Children born to Canadian citizens</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you’re a Canadian citizen who is sponsoring a spouse or partner, and you have a child together, your child may be a Canadian citizen, even if they were not born in Canada.</li>
<li>A Canadian citizen is not eligible to be sponsored.</li>
<li>If you already have proof of Canadian citizenship for your child, provide a copy of this proof (citizenship certificate or copy of Canadian passport), to help us confirm that your child does not require immigrant processing.</li>
<li>If your child was born in Canada, you can provide a copy of their Canadian long form birth certificate(s) instead.</li>
<li>If you don’t have proof of Canadian citizenship for your child who was born outside Canada, you need to apply for a <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/application-citizenship-certificate-adults-minors.html">proof of citizenship</a> to confirm whether your child is a Canadian citizen.</li>
<li>If it is confirmed that your child is a Canadian citizen, you’ll be able to <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-passports/forms.html">apply for your child’s Canadian passport</a>.</li>
<li>If your child is not a Canadian citizen, you’ll need to add them as a dependant on the sponsorship undertaking signed for your spouse or partner.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> If you’ve submitted an application for proof of citizenship for your child, and it hasn’t been finalized, you must provide details in a letter and include it as part of your application so that we can check the status.</p>
<h3>Children born in Canada</h3>
<ul>
<li>If a child was born in Canada, they are likely a Canadian citizen (unless they fall under <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/canadian-citizenship/overview/who-canadian-citizen.html">certain exceptions</a>). A Canadian citizen doesn’t need to be sponsored.</li>
<li>Confirm that your child(ren) don’t fall under an exemption from citizenship by birth in Canada. </li>
<li>If they don’t fall under any exemption, include a copy of their Canadian long form birth certificate(s) with your application.</li>
<li>If you don’t have your child’s long form birth certificate, you need to apply for it.</li>
<li>If your child was born in Canada but falls under an exception (i.e. would not qualify for citizenship), you must provide their long form birth certificate, but they must also be included in the sponsorship. Example: A child born in Canada to an accredited foreign diplomat is not Canadian at birth unless the other parent is a Canadian citizen or permanent resident at the time of the child’s birth.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> If you do not have a child’s Canadian long term birth certificate but have already submitted an application for this to the child’s province or territory of birth, you must provide details in a letter and include it as part of your application.</p>
<h3>Authorized representatives</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you’re using an authorized representative to help you or your family members in any way during the immigration process, each family member over the age of 18 who is being represented must sign their own <a href="/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/kits/forms/imm5476e.pdf">Use of Representative form [IMM 5476] <span data-aem-details="filedetails">(<abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr>, 0.26 MB)</span></a>. To review the instructions for this form, see <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/guide-5561-instructions-use-representative.html">Guide 5561 – Use of Representative</a>.
    <p class="mrgn-tp-md"><strong>Note:</strong> If the sponsor and principal applicant are being represented by the same person, only one form is required. However, this must be signed by both the sponsor and principal applicant.</p>
</li>
<li>If you (the sponsor) will receive correspondence for, or act in any way on behalf of your spouse, partner, or dependent child over the age of 18, the person you are sponsoring (and each represented family member over 18) must complete a <a href="/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/kits/forms/imm5476e.pdf">Use of Representative form [IMM 5476] <span data-aem-details="filedetails">(<abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr>, 0.26 MB)</span></a> authorizing you as their representative.
    <p class="mrgn-tp-md"><strong>Note to sponsors:</strong> if the person you’re sponsoring is living outside Canada, and your address in Canada is provided as their mailing address on the application for permanent residence (IMM 0008), the principal applicant (person you’re sponsoring) must complete a Use of Representative form listing you as their representative.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Marriage certificates</h3>
<ul>
<li>For spousal sponsorships, make sure you include a valid marriage certificate or proof of registration of your marriage with your application (see checklist details). The document(s) you submit must show that the marriage was legally registered with the government where it took place.</li>
<li>A record of solemnization (obtained in Canada) or marriage license will not be accepted as proof that the sponsor and applicant are married.</li>
<li>Check the country specific requirements to see if there are specific instructions for the country where the marriage took place.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Proof of identity documents</h3>
<ul>
<li>Proof of identity is an important part of an application to become a permanent resident:
    <ul>
<li>Carefully review the checklist sections on identity documents, travel documents, and passports.</li>
<li>Make sure you submit a copy of your birth certificate, and (if you have included dependants in your application) the birth certificates of your family members.</li>
<li>We will return the application to you if you don’t provide all the documents requested.</li>
<li>If you are unable to submit a document, you must include a detailed explanation of why you are unable to submit this document so that your application is not automatically returned to you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Original documents</h3>
<ul>
<li>You may be asked to provide an original document during the processing of your application if an IRCC Officer determines it is necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Supporting Documentation</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you are unable to provide supporting documentation, you may provide a letter explaining the reason why you are unable to do so. Provide as much information as you can to avoid processing delays in your application </li>
</ul>
<h3>Letter of Explanation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes a letter of explanation (LoE) may be necessary to better explain your circumstances. This is an opportunity for you to ensure that the processing officer is aware of important information and to avoid any possible confusion. You could upload a letter of explanation in the optional documents section of your online application.</li>
</ul>
<p>The format should include </p>
<ul>
<li>Your contact information</li>
<li>The document checklist item you are reaching out about.</li>
<li>The issue you are trying to clarify.</li>
<li>Any other relevant contextual information that may be necessary to better understand your situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to provide as many details as possible on your LoE to ensure IRCC has all relevant information in order to assess your application properly.</p>
<p><span class="text-uppercase">NOTE</span>: There is no guarantee that your LoE in support of your application will be accepted. Providing an LoE doesn’t guarantee a positive outcome as the final decision remains up to a processing officer.</p>
<h3>Filling out the forms</h3>
<p>Complete all sections on the forms. If a section does not apply to you, write “Not Applicable” or “NA”.</p>
<p>If you need more space for any section, include an additional page containing the appropriate section, complete it and upload it with your application. <strong>For the document type, choose “other.”</strong><strong> Your </strong><strong>other information can be in any of the following formats: JPG, JPEG or PDF.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you don’t know a <strong>complete date of birth</strong>, use “*” (star sign/asterisk) to fill in the spaces for the year, month or day that you don’t know.</li>
<li>If you <strong>don’t have a family name</strong> on your passport or travel document, enter all given names in the family name field</li>
<li>If you <strong>don’t have a given name</strong> on your passport or travel document, leave the given name field blank. IF you need to leave it blank for this reason, you can print the document without validation (if applicable), and include a letter with your application explaining why you had to do this.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Addresses</h3>
<p>Addresses should be written out in full without using any abbreviations. Use the apartment or unit number, if applicable. <strong>Example</strong>: 999 Family Street, Unit #3, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, K3J 9T5</p>
<h3>Email addresses</h3>
<p>To protect your privacy, <strong>we will not use an e-mail address if we can’t clearly read it</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure all email addresses on the forms are correct. Errors will cause delays.</li>
<li>Make sure you’ve correctly typed the email address for the representative (if applicable), the sponsor, and the principal applicant in the correct fields on the IMM 5476, IMM 1344 and IMM 0008.</li>
<li>If you’ve authorized a representative to act on your behalf, we’ll send all correspondence about the application to your representative.</li>
<li>If you’re applying for permanent residence and you’ve authorized your sponsor to act as a representative on your behalf, we’ll send all correspondence about the application to the sponsor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: providing an email address will allow us to communicate with you faster, which can speed up processing times. For more information, see <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/guide-5289-sponsor-your-spouse-common-law-partner-conjugal-partner-dependent-child-complete-guide.html#link">Link your application</a>.</p>
<h2 id="mail">Step 6. Submit the application</h2>
<p>Now that you’ve prepared your application, you can submit it for processing. To help make sure the application can be processed as quickly as possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>answer all questions</li>
<li>electronically sign your application (type your full name exactly as shown on your passport)</li>
<li>include your processing fee receipt</li>
<li>upload all the supporting documents</li>
</ul>
<p>After you read the declaration, you <strong>must</strong> be the one who types your name. This is the legal requirement for your application to be considered “signed,” according to Canada’s <em>Immigration Law</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Principal applicants who are under 18 years of age must have their parent or legal guardian electronically sign the application on their behalf.</strong></p>
<h2 id="after">What to expect after you apply</h2>
<h3>Communicating with IRCC</h3>
<p>There are several ways we may communicate with you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Through your (or your representative’s) online account:</strong> We recommend that you or your authorized paid representative (if applicable) create an online account and link your application to that account. Once an application has been linked to an online account, we will send correspondence there. This makes communication easier, more secure, and quicker and will allow you or your representative to get more detailed application status information and to receive mail from us online. Using online services will ensure that you receive any correspondence (including medical forms and other requests) from us almost immediately after we send it to you. This will allow us to input your responses directly into your application for timely review. </li>
<li><strong>E-Mail:</strong> If you or your representative provide us with an e-mail address when you apply, this will be our primary means of contacting you, unless your application is linked to an online account.</li>
<li><strong>Mail:</strong> If your application is not linked to an online account and no e-mail is provided, we will send all correspondence to the most up-to-date mailing address we have on file.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: Do not attempt to link your application to your personal online account if you have appointed a representative. If you have appointed a representative and attempt to link your application to your own online account, you will have to cancel your representative before you can link.</p>
<p>If you have an authorized paid representative, they can link your application to their own online account instead.</p>
<p>Unpaid representatives cannot use online accounts. If you have an unpaid representative, you should remind them to regularly monitor their e-mail and mail to ensure correspondence is received.</p>
<p>When you authorize the use of a representative, they’ll receive all correspondence about the application on your behalf. It’s important to make sure that we always have your, and your representative’s (if applicable) most current contact information, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Phone numbers</li>
<li>Email addresses</li>
<li>Mailing addresses</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll send time-sensitive and official correspondence using the most up-to-date contact information we have.</p>
<p>If we send a request, an answer must be provided within the timeframe provided.</p>
<p>For more information, see our Help Centre for instruction on <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/account/link-paper-online.html">changing your address or contact information</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If your application was received before someone else’s, but you have not received all of the same requests, don’t be alarmed. Each file is different, and application steps may happen at different times for each file. We will contact you when:</p>
<ul>
<li>we need more information to process your file</li>
<li>an update is available</li>
<li>a decision has been made, or</li>
<li>if your file is transferred to another office for processing</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you regularly check to see if we have contacted you.</p>

<p>Be sure to check the email you gave us when you submitted if you</p>
<ul>
<li>are waiting to hear about your application or </li>
<li>think there may be forms or documents missing </li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Sponsors</h3>
<p>After we receive your application, we’ll check to make sure you’ve submitted all the required forms and documents on the document checklist. If your application package is incomplete, it will be returned to you without being processed. If the application has all the requested forms and documents, you’ll get confirmation that the application has been accepted for processing.</p>
<p>We’ll assess your eligibility to sponsor and you’ll also get an email or letter advising you of the decision.</p>
<ul>
<li>If your sponsorship undertaking is approved, we’ll send the application for permanent residence to the appropriate processing office for further review.</li>
<li>If your sponsorship undertaking is refused, you’ll get an email or letter explaining why.
    <ul>
<li>If you choose to go ahead with the sponsorship even if you are found ineligible to sponsor, the whole application package will be sent to a processing office for further review.</li>

<h3>Do your medical exam</h3>
<p>All of your <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/guide-5289-sponsor-your-spouse-common-law-partner-conjugal-partner-dependent-child-complete-guide.html#family">family members</a> (who are not already a Canadian citizen or permanent resident) need to pass a medical exam, even if they aren’t applying to come to Canada with you. Failure to declare and have family members examined will affect your application, and your ability to sponsor them in the future.</p>
<p>If you have a dependent child who is a minor and you have joint or sole custody, that child is considered a dependant. The child will need a medical exam even if they live with the other parent and won’t be coming with you to Canada.</p>
<p>We’ll send you and each family member a request to complete a medical exam at an appropriate time in processing. This request will include instructions about what to do.</p>
<p>If you have linked your application to an online account, you will receive your instructions in your account immediately after we issue them.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Don’t be concerned if you don’t receive a request to complete medical exams immediately after applying. Because medical results can expire, we might not ask you to do your medical exam right away. This is to reduce the chance that a new medical exam will be required later.</p>
</div>
<p>The request to complete a medical exam will provide instructions about what to do.</p>
<p>Once you get a request for a medical exam, you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Print the IMM 1017 form and the instructions for each person.</li>
<li>Make sure to bring the form to the exam for each person.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do the medical exam within <strong>30 days</strong> of medical instructions being issued to you.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you’ve already completed an immigration medical exam, you must provide details in the “medical examination” section of your document checklist. Depending on when the exam was done, you may have to do it again. If you haven’t completed a medical exam or need to do a new one, we’ll send you instructions.</p>

<h3>Important Notices</h3>
<h4>Important notice about misrepresentation</h4>
<p>If you’re applying to sponsor someone, or you’re applying for permanent residence yourself, you are personally responsible for the content of your application. If you or someone acting on your behalf submits false documents or misrepresents facts relating to your application for a permanent resident visa, your application will be refused and a record of the misrepresentation will be kept. This includes information in your background declaration (IMM 5669 – Schedule A). It also includes any other information you submit in support of your application during processing. Applicants and their dependants could be deemed inadmissible to Canada for five years under subsection 40(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. For more information, see <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/protect-fraud/document-misrepresentation.html">misrepresentation</a>.</p>
<h4>Complying with officer requests in a timely manner</h4>
<p>You must submit any requested documents within timeframes given. If you do not do this, your application may be refused.</p>
<p>If you’ve created an online account, you should monitor it regularly for requests during processing. Responding to our requests as quickly as possible is the best way to make sure your application is processed in a timely manner.</p>
<h4>Requests for additional documents or information</h4>
<p>We may ask you to submit more documents at a later date if we need more information to assess your application. If you’ve created an online account, you should monitor it regularly for requests during processing. Responding to our requests as quickly as possible is the best way to make sure your application is processed in a timely manner.</p>
<p><span class="text-uppercase"><strong>Important</strong></span>: If you don’t respond to a request for information, your application may be refused.</p>
<h4>While your application is being processed</h4>
<p>For information on the estimated time it will take to process your application, you can check <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/check-processing-times.html">current application processing times</a>.</p>
<p>If you or your authorized paid representative (if applicable) have linked your application to an online account, you (or your representative) should check it regularly for any important updates. If you’re not using an online account, you should monitor your preferred method of correspondence (e.g. e-mail or mail) regularly for communications. If you’re using e-mail, you should monitor the account you provided on your application forms regularly (including your spam folder).</p>
<p>If you have a representative, you should direct any questions about the processing of your application to them.</p>
<h4>Open work permits for spouses or common-law partners in Canada</h4>
<p>If you’re applying under the Spouse or Common-Law Partner in-Canada class, you may qualify for an open work permit while your application for permanent residence is being processed.</p>
<p>See the Help Centre for information about <a href="http://www.ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1163&amp;top=17">Open work permits for spouses and partners</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you’re applying under the Spouse or Common-Law Partner in Canada class and you’ve submitted an application for an open work permit, your work permit will normally be processed within four months.</p>
<p>We also recommend that you take the time to <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/prepare-life-canada.html">prepare for life in Canada</a> well in advance.</p>
